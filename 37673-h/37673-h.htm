<h1>NED WILDING&rsquo;S DISAPPEARANCE</h1>



<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE NEW GUN</h3>


<p>The Keene household was suddenly aroused
from peacefulness, one quiet afternoon, by a loud
thud as if something had fallen. It was followed
by a report like an explosion. Then, from Bart&rsquo;s
room, sounded a series of yells.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! Ouch! Jimminities!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s hurt!&rdquo; exclaimed his sister Alice, as
she ran toward her brother&rsquo;s room. As she entered
she saw him running about the apartment,
which was filled with smoke, holding one hand in
the other. Drops of blood were coming from his
fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Are you hurt?&rdquo; asked
Alice. &ldquo;Oh, Bart, are you really hurt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I hurt? Do you think I&rsquo;m doing this for
fun? Where&rsquo;s mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone out. I&rsquo;m the only one home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get a rag or something, will you please
Alice?&rdquo; and Bart danced around on one leg, holding
the other limb out so stiffly that he knocked over
several chairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is your leg hurt too, Bart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s only my three fingers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you stuck one leg out so I thought that
was injured also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d stick &rsquo;em both out if it would only ease
this pain any! Maybe my fingers will have to
come off!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bart! What did it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My new gun. I went to lay it down on the
table and it fell to the floor and went off. Did
you hear it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t very well help it. Did the bullet
go through your hand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t shoot bullets. It shoots shot, and
I guess it only grazed a few fingers. Most of the
shot went into the wall,&rdquo; and Bart gazed at a dark
spot on the wall-paper, and then looked at his injured
hand. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it would go off
so easily,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, those horrid guns!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl.
&ldquo;I just knew when papa let you send for it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Alice, if you ever intend to be a trained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
nurse you&rsquo;d better get to work on me before I
faint!" cried Bart. &ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t talk any more,
that&rsquo;s a good girl. Get a rag before I bleed to
death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bart, I&rsquo;m so sorry! Of course I&rsquo;ll fix
you up. Wait until I get my book,&rdquo; and Alice,
whose ambition was to be a nurse and wear a blue
and white striped uniform, hurried to her room
and came back with a little book. On the cover
was a red cross, and the inscription, &ldquo;First Aid to
the Injured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of a wound is it, Bart?&rdquo; Alice
asked, rapidly turning the leaves of the volume.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How should I know? It&rsquo;s a painful wound,
if that&rsquo;s what you mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! Is it incised or lacerated or a contused
one? Because you see I have to give it
different kind of treatment if it&rsquo;s an incised wound
than I would if it&rsquo;s a lacerated one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, give me any kind of treatment!&rdquo; and
Bart began to dance around again. &ldquo;The shot
grazed my fingers, that&rsquo;s all I know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s a lacerated wound,&rdquo; Alice replied
a little doubtfully, as she took a look at her
brother&rsquo;s bleeding hand. Then she turned to the
page of the book that treated of lacerated hurts
and read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;These wounds have ragged edges and the
skin is torn and bruised.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me all right,&rdquo; interrupted Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They result from force so applied as to tear
rather than cut the tissues cleanly,&rsquo;&rdquo; the girl read
on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m cut all right,&rdquo; put in Bart. &ldquo;Hurry
up Alice, stick some court plaster on and let it go
at that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Bart Keene! I&rsquo;m ashamed of you!
The idea of me putting such a common remedy as
court plaster on a wound! Why, you&rsquo;d get bloodpoison
and other dreadful things! I must treat
this just as I expect to treat other wounds when I
get to be a trained nurse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never get to be one at this rate,&rdquo; Bart
cut in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They are caused by railway and machinery
accidents,&rsquo;&rdquo; Alice read on, &ldquo;&lsquo;by falling timbers,
stones and brick. Such wounds are frequently followed
by shock.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this wasn&rsquo;t a railroad accident, nor one
caused by falling bricks or timber,&rdquo; Bart retorted.
&ldquo;I guess it will come under the head of machinery.
A gun&rsquo;s machinery, I s&rsquo;pose. But I can testify to
the shock. Wow!&rdquo; and, as a sudden spasm of
pain seized him, he snatched his hand from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
grasp of his sister and again began dancing around
on one leg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold still! How can I treat the wound if
you jerk around that way?&rdquo; demanded Alice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Treat the wound! You aren&rsquo;t treating any
wound!&rdquo; retorted Bart. &ldquo;I could treat ten
wounds in that time! All you&rsquo;re doing is talk!
If Fenn Masterson or Ned Wilding was here
they&rsquo;d have a rag around this long ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it would probably be full of germs
and other things and you&rsquo;d be dead of lock-jaw,&rdquo;
said Alice calmly. &ldquo;Now Bart, come here. I
know what kind of a wound it is, and I must see
how to fix it,&rdquo; and once more securing her brother&rsquo;s
hand for examination, she began to leaf over
the book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Treatment,&rsquo;&rdquo; she read. &ldquo;&lsquo;Cleanse the
wound thoroughly with warm water, lay a wet
cloth over it and bandage lightly. If symptoms
of shock are present they must receive careful attention.
See page twenty-two.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind the shock, just get a rag on these
fingers before I lose all the blood I&rsquo;ve got and we&rsquo;ll
talk shock afterward,&rdquo; interrupted Bart.</p>

<p>Then Alice, laying aside her book, brought some
warm water in a basin, and some soft cloths, and
soon had Bart&rsquo;s hand tied up in a sling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got enough rags on here to make my
hand look as big as my head,&rdquo; objected the boy, as
he gazed at the bandage his sister had adjusted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to catch cold in it,&rdquo; she replied.
&ldquo;It is very chilly to-day. I think we&rsquo;re
going to have more snow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ought to have some, with Thanksgiving here
in about a week,&rdquo; replied Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you get hurt?&rdquo; asked his sister again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was examining my new shotgun. It just
came&mdash;Hark! Who&rsquo;s that calling?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, some of the boys I s&rsquo;pose,&rdquo; and Alice
went to the window and looked down to the street,
whence came a series of shrill whistles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Raise the window and I&rsquo;ll yell to &rsquo;em to come
up,&rdquo; said Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you come near this window,&rdquo; commanded
Alice. &ldquo;You forget you&rsquo;re under treatment.
If you should catch cold in that hand it might be
terrible! I&rsquo;ll call the boys. You go back in that
corner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, as Bart meekly obeyed, Alice raised the
sash and called:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come up, boys! Bart is hurt and can&rsquo;t come
down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m in bed,&rdquo; her brother objected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
A few seconds later there sounded the noise of
several feet on the stairs. A moment afterward
three lads hurried into the room. They had just
come from school, but Bart had not attended the
afternoon session.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello Frank!&rdquo; cried Bart. &ldquo;Howdy,
Stumpy? How are you, Ned?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Ned, noticing
the bandage on Bart&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hurt myself with the gun. Went off before
I was ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gun!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got a new gun?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see it,&rdquo; demanded Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here she is,&rdquo; exclaimed Bart, and then, forgetting
his sore hand, he took from the corner a
fine shotgun. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beauty,&rdquo; he went on.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got patent&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh!&rdquo; screamed Alice. &ldquo;Your hand!&rdquo;</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>PREPARING FOR A HUNT</h3>


<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with my hand?&rdquo; asked
Bart holding the gun in the one that had been injured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why you&rsquo;ve taken it from the sling. The
blood will rush to it and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; spoke Bart carelessly,
as he held up the gun. &ldquo;You see fellows,
this is the patent ejector, and the barrels&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well of all things!&rdquo; exclaimed Alice. &ldquo;I
spend a lot of time fixing up your injury and you
go and undo all my work in a minute. I never saw
such a boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you hurt yourself?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had just loaded both barrels and put the
gun on the table. It fell off and something hit one
of the triggers or the hammers and it banged out
like a cannon. My hand was in the way, that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurt much?&rdquo; inquired Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; was Bart&rsquo;s careless answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
But an exclamation of pain escaped him as he
hit his bruised fingers against the gun stock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed Alice. &ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d
do something wrong. Now I suppose it will start
bleeding again,&rdquo; and she turned back as if to undo
the bandage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind!&rdquo; spoke Bart quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
stick some court plaster on if it does. Say Alice
get us some cake and lemonade, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alice agreed and while she prepared the beverage
and got some cakes from the pantry, in which
interval the four boys talked nothing but gun,
there is an opportunity of making you better acquainted
with them. It&rsquo;s hard to be introduced
to a person when he has sustained a smashed
thumb, so it is, perhaps, just as well that the formal
presentation was postponed until now.</p>

<p>Bart Keene, Ned Wilding, Frank Roscoe and
Fenn Masterson, (who was called Stumpy, for
short, because of his rather limited height and
breadth of beam), were four boys who lived in
the town of Darewell. This was located not far
from Lake Erie, on the Still River, a stream in
which the boys fished, swam and upon which they
spent many hours in their big rowboat.</p>

<p>With the exception of Frank Roscoe, the boys
lived in the heart of the town. Their parents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
were fairly well off, and the boys had been chums
since they attended primary school together. In
fact, when their companionship continued on
through the grammar school and into the high
school, they became such a town fixture, in a way,
that they were known as &ldquo;The Darewell Chums.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those of you who have read the first volume
of this series, entitled &ldquo;The Heroes of
the School,&rdquo; know what sort of lads the four
were. Those of you who are meeting them
for the first time may be glad of a little sketch of
their characters.</p>

<p>Frank lived with his uncle, Abner Dent, about
a mile out of town. Mr. Dent was a rich farmer,
and Frank had resided with him as long as he
could remember. He could not recall his father
or mother, and his uncle seldom mentioned them.
Frank was rather a strange sort of boy. His
chums were very fond of him, but they could not
quite make out the curious air of mystery about
him. Frank seemed to have some secret, but his
chums never asked him what it was, though of
late years his odd ways, at times, had attracted
their attention.</p>

<p>Ned Wilding was an impulsive, lively chap, full
of fun, and given to playing tricks, which sometimes
got him into mischief. He was rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
thoughtless, but never mean, and when his actions
did result in trouble for others Ned was always
ready and anxious to make reparation. Ned&rsquo;s
mother was dead and he lived with his father
who was cashier of the Darewell bank.</p>

<p>As for Bart, he was so fond of sports, from
baseball and swimming to snowballing and skating,
that he was seldom still long enough to study his
lessons.</p>

<p>Fenn, or Stumpy Masterson, had only one failing
as far as his chums were concerned. He was
&ldquo;sweet&rdquo; on the girls, as they called it. Fenn
would go to considerable trouble to walk home with
a girl. His chums made all sorts of fun of him,
but he did not seem to mind much. His especial
favorite was Jennie Smith, who was quite fond of
poetry and who liked to recite and act.</p>

<p>As told in the first volume, the boys, during the
summer preceding the winter in which this story
opens, had taken part in some strange adventures.
They discovered that some men in the neighborhood
of the town were acting very queerly, and
they resolved to find what it meant. One day they
went up in a captive balloon at a fair, and the restraining
cable broke. The four chums were carried
off in the airship high above the clouds.</p>

<p>The boys were detained as prisoners aboard a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
barge on the river, because it was learned they
knew something of the mystery the strangely acting
men were trying to keep hidden. By dint of
much pluck and hard work the boys managed to
solve the affair, and, in order to avoid a law-suit,
the men involved offered the boys one thousand
dollars each, in valuable oil stock. This they accepted
and their parents and relatives did not
prosecute the men, as they originally intended, for
detaining the boys on the barge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the lemonade!&rdquo; cried Ned, as Alice
came in with a big pitcherful while the chums
were examining Bart&rsquo;s gun. He took it from the
girl, as it was quite heavy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll get the cakes and glasses,&rdquo; Alice
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me help you,&rdquo; begged Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, you quit that!&rdquo; called Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quit what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walking downstairs with Alice. I&rsquo;ll tell Jennie
on you, Stumpy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you dry up!&rdquo; cried Fenn, and, despite the
boys&rsquo; laughter Fenn accompanied Bart&rsquo;s sister to
the next floor, where he got the cake and glasses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stumpy&rsquo;s as bad as ever,&rdquo; commented Frank.
&ldquo;He reminds me of&mdash;&rdquo; Frank did not finish
his sentence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
&ldquo;Reminds you of what?&rdquo; asked Ned. &ldquo;There
you go again, beginning a thing and not finishing
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll not say it. Doesn&rsquo;t make any difference,&rdquo;
and Frank turned aside and gazed out
of the window.</p>

<p>Bart and Ned looked at each other. It was a
peculiarity of Frank&rsquo;s to begin to say something,
and then seem to recollect a matter that made him
change his mind. But his chums were now used to
his strangeness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you get that gun, Bart?&rdquo; asked
Fenn as he came in with the cake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Saw it advertised in a catalog, and sent to
New York for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eighteen dollars. It was the first money I
used of the thousand I got from the &lsquo;King of
Paprica&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;for such was the assumed name of the
principal man in the mystery the boys had cleared
up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From New York, eh?&rdquo; spoke Ned. &ldquo;That
reminds me I have an invitation to visit my uncle
and aunt there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. You asked us to come and see
you,&rdquo; added Bart. &ldquo;Wish we could go around
Christmas time.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
&ldquo;If the holiday vacation was longer maybe we
could,&rdquo; remarked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speaking of holidays, what&rsquo;s the matter with
going hunting the end of next week?&rdquo; asked Bart.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my gun, and you fellows have your
small rifles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can borrow a shotgun,&rdquo; put in Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Thursday,&rdquo; went on Bart. &ldquo;School
closes to-morrow for the Thanksgiving celebration.
Let&rsquo;s see, Thanksgiving is a week from to-day.
That would give us three days counting
Monday, when we can start off. Why not go
on a shooting trip and stay a couple of nights in
the woods? It&rsquo;s not very cold, and we could take
plenty of blankets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very thing!&rdquo; cried Ned.</p>

<h3>OFF IN THE WOODS</h3>


<p>The town of Darewell, though situated near
the center of a well-populated district, presented
many advantages to the boys. There was the
river to fish in, and it was a deep enough stream to
accommodate steamers and barges up to a certain
point. In addition there was, about five miles
from the place, the beginning of a stretch of unbroken
forest, seldom visited, and which in season
contained much game. It was a favorite hunting
spot, but had not been over-run with gunners.</p>

<p>The boys had, in past summers, camped along
the river and in the woods, but they had not penetrated
far into the forest, as there were few roads
or trails through it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have we got everything?&rdquo; asked Fenn, as
they stood in the front yard of Bart&rsquo;s house, early
the next Monday morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; Ned replied. &ldquo;I looked after the
blankets and such stuff, Bart saw to the tent and
Frank to the portable stove and fixings. I suppose
you&rsquo;ve got the food all packed, Stumpy?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
&ldquo;Everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t forget the salt, did you, the way you
did when we went camping before and had to
borrow of a tramp?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots of salt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about condensed milk?&rdquo; asked Bart.
&ldquo;Remember how you dropped it in the river that
day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I? And how Ned howled because he had
to drink black coffee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;d better take the sled along,&rdquo; suggested
Ned, as he noticed it was beginning to
snow. &ldquo;If it gets deep enough we can haul the
things on it, instead of on the wagon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The camp supplies, including a shelter tent, had
been placed on a wagon, on which they were to be
taken to where the boys decided to make their
first camp. On the large vehicle was a smaller
one, which the chums could load with all their
stuff and haul through the woods, in case they
found it advantageous to move to a section where
there was better hunting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, I&rsquo;ve got an idea!&rdquo; exclaimed
Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make a note of it before you forget it!&rdquo; called
Fenn. &ldquo;Good ideas are scarce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can take runners along for the small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
wagon,&rdquo; Bart went on, not noticing his chum&rsquo;s
sarcasm. &ldquo;There are some adjustable ones I
made a couple of years ago. Then we&rsquo;ll be prepared
for anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wagon was one the boys had built for
themselves several seasons past. They used to
cart their camp outfit on it when they did not
transport the things by boat up or down the river.
As Bart had said, there were adjustable runners,
which could be fitted over the wheels, without
taking them off, and thus on short notice the
wagon could be transformed into a sled.</p>

<p>It was a crisp November day, with a suggestion
of more cold to come, and the first few flakes had
been followed by others while the boys waited until
Bart, whose hand was almost well again, got
the runners from the cellar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks as if we&rsquo;d have quite a storm,&rdquo; remarked
Jim Dodd, the driver of the express
wagon, whom the boys had hired to take their
stuff to a point about two miles inside the woods.
The road, which was made by lumbermen, came
to an end there. &ldquo;Yes sir,&rdquo; Jim went on, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
goin&rsquo; t&rsquo; be a good storm. You boys better stay
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much!&rdquo; cried Ned. &ldquo;A storm is what
we want.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather eat my Thanksgivin&rsquo; turkey in a
warm kitchen than in an old tent,&rdquo; Jim added
with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll be home for Thanksgiving,&rdquo; Fenn
said, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll have plenty of game to eat too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wish ye luck,&rdquo; was Jim&rsquo;s rejoinder.</p>

<p>The adjustable runners were packed on the
wagon, a last look given to see that everything was
in place, and then, about nine o&rsquo;clock the start was
made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep your thumb wrapped up!&rdquo; Alice called
after her brother. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take cold. Drink some
hot ginger tea every night before you boys go to
bed. Keep your coats well buttoned up around
your throats, don&rsquo;t get your feet wet and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, give us the books, sis,&rdquo; called Bart good-naturedly,
&ldquo;we can&rsquo;t remember all that. Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; called Alice, waving her hands to
the chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; the four boys echoed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE FIRST TURKEY</h3>


<p>&ldquo;I must say you boys has got grit,&rdquo; remarked
Jim, as the wagon lurched along, pitching like a
ship in a storm because of the rough road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leavin&rsquo; your comfortable homes an&rsquo; comin&rsquo;
out to a wilderness in winter. Land! I&rsquo;d no more
think of doin&rsquo; it than I would of flyin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you do such things when you were
young?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never had no time,&rdquo; the expressman said.
&ldquo;When I got a few days off I had t&rsquo; go t&rsquo; th&rsquo;
woods an&rsquo; chop cord-wood or tap trees for maple
syrup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They jogged along for another mile or so, the
road getting more and more rough as they progressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe I can take you any farther,&rdquo;
said Jim, as he brought his wagon to a stop before
a big bog-hole. For the last mile the road was
&ldquo;corduroy,&rdquo; that is, made by laying small logs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
across it, close together, like the ribs in corduroy
cloth; whence its name.</p>

<p>The boys helped the expressman to unload, and,
with his aid they soon had cleared a place among
the trees for the tent. It was put up, and then the
camp stuff and provisions were taken inside.</p>

<p>Stumpy quickly had ready a meal, which, if it
was not elaborate, was appetizing, and Jim who
was invited to it had to acknowledge that the coffee
was good enough for anyone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for a turkey hunt!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned,
when Jim had left and his wagon was out of sight
on the wood road. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got all the afternoon.
Let&rsquo;s get the guns and start out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The snow was coming down faster now, and the
wind had increased. It was not very cold, however,
and they were warmly dressed so they did not
mind it. They had a compass with them, to avoid
getting lost, and, confident they would return laden
with turkeys or rabbits, they tramped on
through the woods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, fellows! Here&rsquo;s something!&rdquo; cried
Frank suddenly, pointing to some tracks in the
snow. His companions ran to where he stood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turkey tracks!&rdquo; called Bart. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re leading
off into the woods, too! Come on! We&rsquo;ll get
some birds now!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
The new-fallen snow deadened their footsteps or
they would have frightened all the game within a
mile, the way they rushed through the forest.
They had never hunted wild turkeys, and did not
know what shy birds they are.</p>

<p>So it was more by good luck than good management
that they suddenly came upon a small flock,
gathered about a big gobbler. The birds were in
a little clearing, standing rather disconsolately
about in the snow.</p>

<p>Bart, who was leading, came to an abrupt halt
as he saw the flock through the bushes. He motioned
for the others to remain quiet. Then he
carefully brought his gun to bear on the big gobbler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to give us a shot?&rdquo; asked
Ned in a whisper. He and the others were standing
behind Bart, and could not get a fair aim at
the turkeys, as the trail was a narrow one and Bart
occupied the most of it.</p>

<p>The whisper, as it was, gave the alarm to the
easily frightened birds. The gobbler raised its
head and sounded one note of warning. But Bart
shot at the instant. The flock scattered in all directions
and the other boys fired wildly in the hope
of getting a bird.</p>

<p>When the smoke had blown away the chums<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
peered eagerly forward, expecting to see at least
four turkeys lying on the snow-covered ground.
Bart ran up, hoping the big gobbler had fallen to
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t we kill any?&rdquo; asked Frank, as they
saw nothing but turkey tracks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks as if we all missed,&rdquo; remarked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, here&rsquo;s one, and it&rsquo;s a fine one too!&rdquo; exclaimed
Frank, as he ran to one side and picked
up a plump hen from under a bush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who aimed at that one?&rdquo; asked Bart, much
disappointed at missing his gobbler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hard to say,&rdquo; said Ned. &ldquo;I guess we can all
claim a share in it. We each shot one-fourth of a
turkey. Not so bad for a starter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m out of it,&rdquo; Bart rejoined. &ldquo;I aimed
straight at the gobbler, and he got away. It&rsquo;s a
third of a bird apiece for you fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyhow it is the first turkey of the hunt,&rdquo;
observed Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and my gun is christened,&rdquo; added Bart.</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE BLIZZARD</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Now for some more game!&rdquo; cried Ned, as
Frank tied the legs of the turkey and slung the
bird across his back in true hunter fashion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;ll have to tramp a long distance
before we get any more,&rdquo; remarked Fenn. &ldquo;All
the turkeys for a mile around heard the guns and
they&rsquo;ll keep to deep cover.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However the boys, ever hopeful, resumed their
tramp. They found plenty of turkey tracks but no
birds, and, after covering several miles, decided to
make their way back to camp, as it was getting dark
early on account of the storm.</p>

<p>They got the right direction, by means of the
compass, and were within about a mile of where
they had set up the tent when Bart, who was
ahead, suddenly halted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Fenn, as he saw his chum
aiming his gun up through the low branches of a
tree near which he had stopped.</p>

<p>For answer Bart fired. There was a flutter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
big wings, a protesting gobble or two, and a big
turkey cock fell to the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, I knew I&rsquo;d get him!&rdquo; Bart cried as
he ran forward and secured his prize. &ldquo;I saw him
roosting up in the branches, and I fired before he
could get away. I knew I&rsquo;d get him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think this is the same one you fired
at a while ago, do you?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s one just as big and just as good,&rdquo;
retorted Bart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m satisfied if he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He slung the gobbler, which was a large fat
one, over his shoulder and went on, much pleased
with himself and his new gun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;ll have roast turkey to-night all
right,&rdquo; Frank remarked as they trudged along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess not, if I have to cook it!&rdquo; exclaimed
Fenn. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late to dress any birds to-night.
Canned stuff and coffee for yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, to-morrow then,&rdquo; Frank insisted.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to have a turkey dinner while we&rsquo;re
in the woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was almost dark when they reached camp.
They lighted some lanterns, and built a big fire,
while Fenn, who had been elected cook, got supper
ready. The other boys cleared out the tent for
sleeping purposes.</p>

<p>When the boys awoke in the morning it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
to find the ground covered about a foot deep with
snow. The flakes had ceased falling, but it was
much colder, and there was a stiff wind. Gray
clouds covered the sky, and altogether it was
rather a cheerless prospect.</p>

<p>But the boys&rsquo; spirits were proof against almost
anything. With some hot coffee to warm them
up, and some hot canned meat, which Fenn prepared,
they were ready for another day of tramping
through the woods after game.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you say to moving camp?&rdquo; suggested
Bart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ve scared from
around here whatever there was in the way of turkeys
and rabbits. We can put our stuff on the
sled and pull it through the snow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was agreed to, and soon the runners were
adjusted over the wheels, and the four boys were
pulling the sleigh with the camp outfit.</p>

<p>They went slowly, picking their way as best
they could among the trees. On a down grade,
where two were enough at the rope, Bart and
Frank went ahead to see if they could observe any
signs of game. Frank killed a fat rabbit, but
Bart fired at one and missed.</p>

<p>They went about four miles farther into the
forest and, as they saw turkey tracks, they decided
to camp there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have an early dinner, put the turkey hen
on to roast, and go off hunting the rest of the day,&rdquo;
decided Fenn.</p>

<p>The turkey was prepared in a somewhat rough
fashion and put to roast in the oven of the portable
stove. When it was nearly done the fire was allowed
to cool down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All we have to do when we get back is to
start a small blaze and we&rsquo;ll have hot turkey,&rdquo; explained
Fenn. Some dry wood was placed within
the tent to keep it safe in case it began to snow
again, and, fastening the flaps, the boys set off.</p>

<p>They had better luck this time, and managed to
get a turkey apiece, though they were only hens,
and not very large.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We ought to each get a big gobbler before we
go back home,&rdquo; Bart said. &ldquo;You fellows want
to look alive. I&rsquo;ve got mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had all the luck,&rdquo; retorted Ned.</p>

<p>But the gobblers seemed too wise to come within
the reach of the boys&rsquo; guns, and when it came time
to make back-tracks for camp there was none numbered
among the slain. Several more rabbits had
been secured, however, and the boys were well satisfied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mouth waters for that roast turkey,&rdquo; exclaimed
Ned, as he tramped through the snow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
&ldquo;I want a piece of the breast and some of the
brown skin. Just a bit of dressing, please, and a
spoonful of gravy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let up!&rdquo; cried Bart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m half starved!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned&rsquo;s anticipations of the turkey were fully realized.
It may not have been done just to the
turn a French chef would call proper, but the boys
thought they had never eaten anything half so
good. There was little left when they had finished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better circle around so&rsquo;s to fetch up near
where Jim&rsquo;s to meet us to-night,&rdquo; remarked Bart
as they crawled out of the blankets Wednesday
morning. The cold had increased and the wind
was blowing half a gale.</p>

<p>The tent was struck, after a hasty breakfast, and,
with the other things, not forgetting the game, was
packed upon the sled. The boys started off, intending
to make a large circle and bring up that
evening where Jim had left them, in time to meet
him. They would not erect the tent again.</p>

<p>They managed to kill several hen turkeys, another
gobbler, which fell to Ned&rsquo;s gun, and a
couple of rabbits, but most of the game seemed to
have disappeared, and there was no more in the
vicinity of where the boys tramped, dragging the
sled after them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
They halted for dinner in a dense part of the
forest, and, after the meal, started for the place
where the corduroy road ended. They judged it
to be about six miles from where they were, and
knew it would take them about until night-fall to
reach it.</p>

<p>It was hard work, pulling the sled, but the exercise
kept them warm, and they trudged on, plunging
into drifts which the wind quickly raised. It
started to snow again and the flakes began to blow
across their path whipped into stinging particles
by the force of the gale. They were enveloped in
a white cloud through which they could see only
dimly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, it&rsquo;s getting worse and worse!&rdquo; exclaimed
Ned, as he paused for breath after a particularly
stiff bit of pulling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boys, it&rsquo;s a regular blizzard, that&rsquo;s what it
is,&rdquo; cried Bart. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re certainly in for it now.
I don&rsquo;t believe Jim will come for us in a storm
like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t a blizzard it&rsquo;s the best imitation of
one I ever saw,&rdquo; remarked Frank. &ldquo;What are we
going to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only thing is to keep on,&rdquo; replied Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we going in the right direction?&rdquo; asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Ned. &ldquo;Fenn, suppose you take a look at the compass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fenn, who carried the little instrument, reached
in his overcoat pocket for it. He did not find it.
Then he looked in several other pockets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Haven&rsquo;t lost it, have
you?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so. Didn&rsquo;t I give it to you, Ned,
this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never saw it,&rdquo; replied Ned.</p>

<p>Fenn made a more thorough search. The compass
was not to be found. The boys stood there
helplessly, in the midst of the howling storm, which
was now at its height.</p>

<p>The snow was a blinding, scurrying, mass of
flakes which stung their faces like needles. Overhead
the trees were bending to the blast and the
gale was roaring through the branches. There
was no path. Ten feet ahead it looked like a blank
white wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boys, we&rsquo;re lost in the woods, and the blizzard
is getting worse!&rdquo; cried Bart, almost having to
shout to make himself heard above the storm.</p>

<h3>A LONELY CABIN</h3>


<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep on! We may find the place where we
were to meet Jim,&rdquo; advised Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Bart said. &ldquo;That would be foolish.
Jim would never come for us on such a night. Besides,
we don&rsquo;t know which way to go. We&rsquo;d better
camp here until the storm blows over. We&rsquo;ve
got everything we need, but it&rsquo;s not going to be
much fun under a tent in this weather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get down more in a hollow,&rdquo; suggested
Fenn. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re on a hill here and get the full
force of the wind. If we go on a bit we may find
a better place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good idea!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart. &ldquo;Come on,
fellows!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He seized hold of the sled rope and began to
pull, the others joining him. There was no choice
of direction, so they turned to get the wind on their
backs.</p>

<p>With grim perseverance they kept on. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
wind seemed fairly to carry them forward, though
it was hard to struggle through the drifts they encountered
every once in a while. As they had no
particular path to take, they avoided the big hummocks
of snow as much as they could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to stop!&rdquo; declared Fenn, after a bit
of hard pulling. &ldquo;My wind&rsquo;s giving out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish the wind up above would,&rdquo; murmured
Bart as he tried to peer through the clouds
of flakes to see where they were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stay here,&rdquo; suggested Fenn. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;ve
got to camp in the storm this place is as good as
any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say,&rdquo; remarked Frank. &ldquo;This
seems to be well sheltered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There came a momentary let-up to the gale.
The snow did not seem to fall so thickly and the
boys eagerly looked around them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something over that way!&rdquo; cried Ned,
pointing to the left. &ldquo;It looked like a barn or
house. Let&rsquo;s try for it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the wind swept down on them again, blotting
out, in the swirl of flakes, whatever Ned had
seen. But he had an idea of the direction it was
in, and started off toward it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, come back and help pull the sled!&rdquo;
cried Bart, and the four boys, led by Ned, dragged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the heavy load toward the spot where the building
had been noticed.</p>

<p>They did not see it again until they were within
ten feet of it, and then made out a lonely cabin
in the midst of a clearing in the woods. The snow
was half way up to the first floor window sills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some one inside!&rdquo; shouted Bart, as
he saw smoke curling from the chimney. &ldquo;Knock
on the door! I&rsquo;m half frozen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there was no need to knock. The door
was opened and a little girl peered out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can we come in and get warm?&rdquo; asked Ned.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re lost in the storm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; asked a woman&rsquo;s voice, as she
came to the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were camping out,&rdquo; explained Bart, &ldquo;and
the storm caught us as we were about to go home.
We live in Darewell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; the woman exclaimed. &ldquo;Our
cabin is poor enough but it is better than the woods
in such a storm. I&rsquo;m sorry we can&rsquo;t offer you
anything to eat, but we have only a little for ourselves
and there&rsquo;s no telling when we&rsquo;ll get more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And to-morrow&rsquo;s Thanksgiving,&rdquo; murmured
Ned in a low voice.</p>

<p>The boys stamped the snow from their feet and
entered the cabin. There were two rooms downstairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and two up. In the apartment they entered
was a stove in which a wood fire burned. In one
corner stood a table with a few dishes on it, and
there was a cupboard. Some chairs completed the
furnishings. Close to the fire, clad in a ragged
dress, sat a little girl. The boys needed but one
glance to see that the family was in dire straits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Perry,&rdquo; the woman said. &ldquo;I live
here with my two daughters. The town of Kirkville
supports us. The poormaster brought some
food last week but he hasn&rsquo;t been here this week,
and we are afraid he can not come because of the
storm. Otherwise I could offer you something to
eat,&rdquo; and she turned aside her head to hide her
tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, mother,&rdquo; exclaimed the child who
had been sitting near the fire. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not very
hungry, and maybe the snow will stop. We had a
nice Thanksgiving last year&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ll have a poor one to-morrow,&rdquo;
Mrs. Perry replied. &ldquo;But boys, come closer to the
fire. You must be cold. At least we have plenty
of wood. That is free, and my daughters gathered
a lot the other day in the woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Perry&mdash;ahem, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;that is&mdash;er&mdash;I
mean&mdash;Oh, hang it! Ain&rsquo;t any of you going
to help a fellow out!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned, clearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
his throat with unnecessary violence. &ldquo;What I
mean is we&rsquo;ve got a lot of things to eat, on our
sled. We&rsquo;d be glad to have you&mdash;Oh, here!
Boys come on out and bring in some of the
things!&rdquo; and before the astonished woman knew
what was happening Ned and his chums were out
in the snow fairly tearing the things off the sled.
In they trooped again, bearing turkeys, rabbits, and
a lot of the camp food they had not eaten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s just like Santa Claus!&rdquo; cried the little
girl. &ldquo;I knew we&rsquo;d have Thanksgiving, mommey!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mrs. Perry was crying, with her head down
on the table.</p>

<p>Indeed the room did look as if it was ready for
some sort of holiday feast. It was fairly crowded
with the things the boys had brought in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t know what to say,&rdquo; Mrs.
Perry exclaimed, as she dried her eyes. &ldquo;Are you
sure you can spare so much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spare it? Say we&rsquo;ve eaten so much lately
we&rsquo;ll be sick!&rdquo; broke in Bart, with a laugh.
&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll make a better fire, and if you&rsquo;ll get
some of these turkeys and rabbits ready you can
have a dinner. There&rsquo;s some other things,&mdash;canned
stuff, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time the older girl, whose name, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
boys learned, was Jane, was placing some of the
things aside. Her mother helped her, while Mary,
the younger daughter, seemed, from mere astonishment,
unable to stir. She sat gazing at the pile
of good things as if they might suddenly vanish.</p>

<p>The boys brought in more wood and began to
help with the meal. In a little while they had a
good one ready, using some of the camp food,
while the turkeys and rabbits were put away for
the next day.</p>

<p>The boys told something of themselves, and, in
turn, Mrs. Perry related how her husband had
died a few years before, leaving her with a small
farm, and three children, a boy and the two girls.
The farm, she said, had been taken because they
could not pay the interest on the mortgage, and
there had been nothing left for them.</p>

<p>The town gave them the use of the little cabin,
and they managed to make something of a living,
for Mrs. Perry did sewing for women in the village,
which was about three miles away. They
had a little garden patch, and raised some fruit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said you&mdash;you had a son?&rdquo; asked Ned
gently. &ldquo;Is he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he isn&rsquo;t dead,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Perry sadly.
&ldquo;Poor boy, I wish I knew where he was. He
tried to help us, as much as he could,&rdquo; she went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
on. &ldquo;But there was no work for him around here,
and so he decided to try and get work. He went
to the city and wrote me that he was going to sea.
He said he had a good position, and would send
me some money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never heard from him since,&rdquo; the
widow replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he is dead,&rdquo; and she
began to cry again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; suggested Ned, as cheerfully as
he could. &ldquo;Maybe he is on a long voyage and
can&rsquo;t write. Or perhaps he has written and the
letters have gone astray. I would not worry. He
may come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Willie is alive,&rdquo; remarked Jane. &ldquo;He
was a very proud boy, and perhaps when he found
he could not earn money enough to send home, he
decided to stay away until he could. Maybe he is
ashamed to come home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he knows I would forgive him! I would
be glad to see him if he never had a penny!&rdquo; exclaimed
Mrs. Perry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;ll turn up all right,&rdquo; put in Fenn.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s only waiting until he can come back rich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been about a year now,&rdquo; the widow went
on. &ldquo;Willie was fifteen when he left, and he&rsquo;d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
be sixteen now. It&rsquo;s his first birthday away from
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys did their best to comfort her, and she
seemed to feel a little better after telling her troubles.
The girls were certainly more cheerful after
the meal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You boys had better stay all night,&rdquo; Mrs.
Perry suggested. &ldquo;The storm is getting worse.
If you don&rsquo;t mind being crowded we can accommodate
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we can sleep on the floor in the kitchen we&rsquo;ll
be glad to,&rdquo; Ned answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have Willie&rsquo;s bed, which no one uses, and
there is another,&rdquo; the widow replied. &ldquo;I have
always kept his room ready for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll stay for the night, thank you,&rdquo;
Fenn said.</p>

<p>The storm did appear to be getting worse, or
else the howling of the wind about the lonely cabin
made it seem so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>HOME FOR THANKSGIVING</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! It&rsquo;s stopped snowing!&rdquo; exclaimed
Ned as he looked out of the little window on
the second floor of the cabin the next morning.
&ldquo;Maybe we can get home for Thanksgiving!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; Bart answered. &ldquo;The folks will
be worried. Wonder if Jim is waiting for us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much! Jim&rsquo;s too fond of his comfort to
come out in such weather,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>

<p>The boys found the widow had breakfast ready
for them. She told them their best plan would be
to go to Kirkville, which could be reached by the
road leading from the cabin. From that village
it was seven miles to Darewell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a long pull,&rdquo; remarked Ned.
&ldquo;But I guess we can make it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go out and see how the snow is,&rdquo; suggested
Bart.</p>

<p>They found though it was quite deep it was dry
and soft so that tramping through it, and pulling
the sled, would not be so great an exertion as it
otherwise would have been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to take it easy, and we may get
home in time for dinner,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;Pity,
though, we can&rsquo;t have some of our own game
cooked for the feast, but we&rsquo;ll not arrive in time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll leave most of it with her. What
do you say?&rdquo; asked Bart, and he nodded toward
the cabin, outside of which the boys stood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure thing!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn. &ldquo;I wish we
could find her son for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can, some day,&rdquo; remarked Ned.
&ldquo;But we&rsquo;d better go in to breakfast and then get
started.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hardly feel like taking all this,&rdquo; Mrs. Perry
said as she looked at the rabbits and turkeys the
boys left. They had reserved a turkey and some
rabbits each but left all the rest. &ldquo;It hardly
seems right,&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why it&rsquo;s no more than we owe you,&rdquo; said Bart
quickly. &ldquo;We never could have stayed all night
out in that blizzard in our tent. I don&rsquo;t know what
we would have done if it hadn&rsquo;t been that we saw
your house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only wish I had had better accommodations
to offer you,&rdquo; the widow said. &ldquo;But we have
nothing except what charity gives us. In the spring
Jane hopes to get a place to work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we could help you,&rdquo; suggested Ned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
&ldquo;My father knows a number of business men and
he might get Jane a place in a store.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, if he only would!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl.
&ldquo;I do so want to help mother. I must take Willie&rsquo;s
place&mdash;until he comes back,&rdquo; she added a
little sadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My poor boy,&rdquo; Mrs. Perry exclaimed with a
sigh. &ldquo;I wonder if he will have as nice a Thanksgiving
dinner as we will, thanks to the generosity
of you boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hope so,&rdquo; said Fenn. &ldquo;So you haven&rsquo;t
any idea where he is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the least. He used to say he wanted to
see New York, as I suppose all boys do. But I
hardly believe he is there. I wish I knew where he
was. He should come home, pride or not, no matter
if he hasn&rsquo;t a cent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;New York,&rdquo; murmured Ned. &ldquo;I expect to
go there soon. I might see Willie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! If you only could!&rdquo; exclaimed Jane.
&ldquo;Tell him to come home at once. You can
easily recognize him. He has a little red scar on
his right cheek. He fell and cut himself on a
stone when he was a baby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;New York is a big place,&rdquo; said Mrs. Perry.
&ldquo;You are not very likely to see my boy. But if
you should&mdash;tell him his mother prays for him&mdash;every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
night!&rdquo; and, unable to keep her feelings in
control the widow burst into tears.</p>

<p>It was rather an awkward moment for the boys,
but little Mary saved the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to New York!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; right now with these nice boys. They
can pull me on their sled!&rdquo; and she ran to get her
bonnet and cloak.</p>

<p>This raised a laugh, and Mrs. Perry recovered
her composure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not now, dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Sometime,
maybe,&rdquo; and she smiled through her tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we must be going,&rdquo; remarked Fenn.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re ever so much obliged to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I am in your debt,&rdquo; the widow replied.
&ldquo;If you are ever out this way again come
and see us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will!&rdquo; the boys cried as they put on their
things and started off with the sled. It was lighter
now that the load of camp food and much of the
game was off, though the boys found it heavy
enough before they had gone a couple of miles.
But they were determined to reach home as soon
as possible and kept on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty tough, eh?&rdquo; remarked Ned, after a
silence of several minutes, as he nodded back in
the direction of the cabin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; replied Bart. &ldquo;Glad we could
do something to help &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys found, on inquiring from a farmer
they met, that, by taking a short cut through the
woods, they could get on the road to Darewell
without going to Kirkville. This would save them
a mile, and, though they might be able to hire a
horse and wagon in the village, they thought it
better to take the short cut.</p>

<p>They were just turning from the woods into the
highway that led to Darewell, which was about
five miles away, when they heard the jingle of
sleigh bells back of them. Turning they saw coming
along a big sled drawn by two horses. A boy
was on the seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a chance for a ride!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in luck. We can offer to pay him to take
us home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They waited until the sled was close to them and
hailed the driver. He turned and they saw it was
their old enemy, Sandy Merton. Sandy had been
employed by the men in the secret which the four
boys were instrumental in bringing to disclosure,
but had lost his position and gone to work for
a farmer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, eh?&rdquo; asked Sandy with a sneer,
as he saw the four chums.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
There was a moment&rsquo;s hesitation among them.
They did not relish the idea of asking him for a
ride. But still less did they like the thought of
pulling their heavy sled five miles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Sandy!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned. &ldquo;This
is a strict business proposition. Will you drive us
to Darewell for four dollars, and take our sled?
That&rsquo;s a dollar apiece, and it&rsquo;s more than livery
prices. We&rsquo;re not asking you out of friendship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, and I guess you&rsquo;d better not!&rdquo; exclaimed
Sandy. &ldquo;Not the way you acted toward me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We never injured you in any way!&rdquo; said
Bart. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re not going to discuss that now.
Will you give us a lift for money, or won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well I won&rsquo;t, and that&rsquo;s my answer!&rdquo; cried
Sandy, in sudden and unreasonable rage. &ldquo;You
fellows think you&rsquo;re mighty smart. But this time
is where I&rsquo;ve got the upper hand. I wouldn&rsquo;t
take you to Darewell for ten dollars apiece. You
can go off hunting and enjoy yourself while other
folks work. Then because you get lost in the
woods you think every one you meet has got to
give you a ride. Not much! You can walk to
Darewell!&rdquo; And whipping up his horses Sandy
drove on, laughing loudly at the predicament of
the chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Might have known better than to ask him,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
murmured Ned. &ldquo;Well, fellows, I guess we&rsquo;ll
have to walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was easier traveling in the road than through
the woods and across the fields, but still it was
hard work. However, they managed to get a
lift from a farmer when they were within a mile
of town. They hitched their sled to the back of
his sleigh and the man obligingly took them to
Bart&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! There are the boys!&rdquo; exclaimed Alice
as she looked from the window. &ldquo;Look, Jennie,
they have some game. I can see the turkey feathers!&rdquo;
she added to her friend, who had called.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here we are!&rdquo; cried Bart, as his sister and
her chum came running down the front walk.
&ldquo;Just in time for dinner!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bart wanted his chums to come into his house,
but they were in a hurry to tell their folks of their
safe arrival, so, shouldering their guns, and dividing
the game, the boys separated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>GETTING SQUARE WITH SANDY</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Come Alice, help me carry this game into the
house,&rdquo; said Bart when the excitement over their
arrival had quieted down a bit. His rabbits and
the turkey were on the sled with the camp stuff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all the luck you had?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Keene, as he came out on the porch to greet his
son. &ldquo;Why I thought you&rsquo;d come loaded down.
We didn&rsquo;t buy anything for dinner, thinking you&rsquo;d
have enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bart knew by his father&rsquo;s tone that he was only
joking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We did have fine luck,&rdquo; the boy replied, and
then he told about the widow and how they had
left her with plenty of food.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Keene. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d
brought home any more game than you did, and
hadn&rsquo;t left her some I&rsquo;d make you go back to Mrs.
Perry without your dinner. You did right, Bart.
I&rsquo;m glad to hear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bart ate his Thanksgiving dinner with an appetite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
that astonished even himself. Jennie Smith
remained, as the guest of Alice, and she kept those
about the table in lively mood, reciting bits of
verse.</p>

<p>During the course of the meal Bart told of their
trip, and more about the widow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t hardly know what to do when that
blizzard came up,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Wonder if Jim went
to meet us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he came here and said he was expected
to be at the end of the corduroy road for you,&rdquo;
Mr. Keene explained. &ldquo;I said I guessed you boys
would know what to do. Besides, it is doubtful if
he could have gotten his wagon through the drifts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the afternoon Bart&rsquo;s chums came over. Ned
said he had spoken to his father about the Perry
family, and Mr. Wilding was going to get Jane
a place to work. Mr. Keene expressed a wish
to help the widow, and arrangements were made
to see that she did not suffer any more for lack
of food or clothing for herself and daughters.
When the roads were better Mrs. Keene went to
visit Mrs. Perry, and Jane secured a place in a
store in Kirkville, so she could come home every
night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now if we could only find the widow&rsquo;s son for
her we&rsquo;d have that family in pretty good shape,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
remarked Bart to his chums one morning early in
December as they were on their way to school
after the Thanksgiving holidays. &ldquo;Accidentally
we were able to do quite a lot for them, but I&rsquo;d
like to do more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad Jane has a place,&rdquo; observed Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good thing it isn&rsquo;t in Darewell,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;d be hanging around the store
where she was whenever you had the chance,
Stumpy, to see her home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank did not dodge quickly enough to escape
the snowball Fenn threw at him, and caught it on
the head. But he laughed good-naturedly. It was
the price for his joke and he was willing to pay it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go skating this afternoon,&rdquo; suggested
Bart. &ldquo;The river edge is fine almost up to the
Riffles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a
race.&rdquo;</p>

<p>School was dismissed for the day at three o&rsquo;clock
and as soon as they were out the boys hurried
home for their skates. The weather was crisp and
cold, just right for a fine spin up the frozen stream.</p>

<p>The four chums were soon gliding over the
smooth surface on which were a number of other
boys and girls enjoying the sport.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t room to expand here,&rdquo; said Bart,
after they had skated around on the broad expanse
of the river near the town. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go up
a mile or two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His chums agreed, and they were soon racing up
the stream toward the &ldquo;Riffles&rdquo; a shallower place
where, in summer, there was good fishing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see who&rsquo;ll be first to the dead pine!&rdquo;
cried Bart, pointing to a lightning-blasted tree on
the river&rsquo;s edge about a mile up. All four dashed
off at top speed.</p>

<p>There was little difference in the ability of the
boys when it came to skating. They were as much
at home on the steel runners as they were on the
baseball diamond, and were speedy skaters. Forward
they went, stooping over to avoid the wind
resistance as much as possible, the metal of their
skates singing merrily in the crisp winter air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for the last rush!&rdquo; cried Bart, as he put
on an extra burst of speed. His companions responded
to the call, but Bart had a little the best of
them, and was first at the goal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll beat you going back!&rdquo; cried Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s rest a while,&rdquo; suggested Frank.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys turned suddenly at the sound of loud
shouting on the road which, at this point, ran close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to the river. It was someone trying to stop a
team of horses, attached to a sleigh and, to judge
by the noise, the animals were running away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoa! Whoa there!&rdquo; cried the driver.</p>

<p>An instant later the team dashed from the road
and came straight for the river, the driver trying
in vain to stop them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Sandy Merton!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart.</p>

<p>Before the boys could say any more the horses
had run out on the ice of the river, near the chums.
Fortunately it was thick enough to bear the weight
of the animals or it might have proved a disastrous
runaway. As it was, Sandy, in trying to stop the
horses, lost one rein. He pulled sharply on the
other and the steeds, obeying it, turned quickly to
the left. In an instant the sleigh, with its load of
feed, in bags, was overturned on the ice and Sandy
was spilled out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quick! Grab the horses!&rdquo; cried Bart, and
the chums were soon at the bridles. But the animals
appeared satisfied with the damage they had
done, and stood still. Sandy picked himself up,
for he was not hurt, and came to the heads of the
horses. He looked at the overturned sleigh, with
the bags of feed scattered on the ice, and murmured:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll catch it for this.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
&ldquo;I rather guess he will,&rdquo; said Bart in a low
tone, as the temper of Silas Weatherby, for whom
Sandy worked, was well known in that locality.</p>

<p>For a few moments Sandy stood surveying the
scene. It looked as if it would take several men
to set matters right, even if the sleigh was not
broken. Then Sandy, with a sigh, set to work unhitching
the horses. He led them from the ice
and tied them to a tree on shore. Then he began
moving the bags of feed so as to get a clear place
around the vehicle. The chums watched him for
a few minutes. They were thinking, as no doubt
Sandy was, of that day when he had refused them
a lift.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good chance to get square,&rdquo; murmured
Bart to his companions. &ldquo;We could sit down and
watch him sweat over this, and laugh&mdash;but we
won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he added quickly. &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t our way.
We&rsquo;ll get square with Sandy by helping him out in
his trouble. That&rsquo;ll make him feel just as badly
as if we sat and laughed at him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was an application of the Biblical injunction
of heaping coals of fire, but it is doubtful if the
boys thought of it in that light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; cried Bart. He began to take off
his skates, and his chums followed his example.
Then, to the great surprise of Sandy, they began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
to help him move the bags away so they could get
at the sled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say&mdash;say&mdash;fellows&mdash;&rdquo; began Sandy, as the
thought of his own mean conduct, that day on the
road, came to him. &ldquo;Say&mdash;I don&rsquo;t deserve this.
I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You dry up!&rdquo; commanded Bart.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>SANTA CLAUS IN SCHOOL</h3>


<p>The four chums pitched in with a will and
helped Sandy. They did not talk much, for, take
it all in all, it was rather an embarrassing situation.
Sandy did not know what to say, and the boys did
not feel like entering into friendly conversation.</p>

<p>They did not care to be sociable with Sandy
after what he had done, not only in regard to refusing
them a ride, but in the matter of the oil
barge. But they could not see anyone in such a
plight as Sandy was, through no fault of his own,
and not render assistance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The horses took fright and ran away,&rdquo; Sandy
explained, when most of the bags had been piled
on shore. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stop &rsquo;em. The load was
too heavy, and it was down hill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chums did not answer. Sandy did not expect
they would. The situation was too novel.
But he was grateful for their help, and, doubtless
resolved not to act meanly toward them in the
future. The trouble with Sandy was he had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
strength of character. He was mean in spite of
himself, and couldn&rsquo;t help it.</p>

<p>When the bags were out of the way the five
boys, by dint of hard work, managed to right the
sleigh, which was a big double bob. It was not
damaged to any extent and soon was ready to
receive the bags of feed. They were piled in and
the horses hitched up again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m much obliged to you fellows,&rdquo; said
Sandy in a mumbling tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t
give you a ride that day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sandy meant that. He was much softened by
what the chums had done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d made up our minds to get square with
you,&rdquo; said Bart, as he fastened on his skates.
&ldquo;And I think we did, Sandy,&rdquo; and with that the
four chums started off down the river, while Sandy
drove the horses up into the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Queer way to get square,&rdquo; murmured Ned.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to punch his face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was the best way,&rdquo; Bart replied, and,
somehow, though perhaps they didn&rsquo;t know just
why, the chums agreed with him.</p>

<p>Christmas was approaching, and mingled with
the joys of the holiday season, were thoughts in
the minds of the four chums and all the other
pupils, that school would close for two weeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
&ldquo;Next Wednesday is Christmas,&rdquo; observed Bart
one afternoon as the chums were on their way
home. &ldquo;School closes Tuesday for the two weeks,
and we ought to mark the occasion in some way.
Have you fellows heard of any celebration?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nary a one,&rdquo; replied Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s going to be something doing,
all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to do it?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, not the fellow who invited the cow to
school,&rdquo; replied Bart, referring to an incident for
which Ned was responsible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, maybe, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; and Bart winked his left eye.</p>

<p>There was little studying done on Monday of
Christmas week, and less was in prospect for the
following Tuesday. Some of the classes had arranged
for informal exercises in their rooms and
later there was to be a general gathering of all
the pupils of the school in the large auditorium,
at which Mr. McCloud the principal would make
an address.</p>

<p>Monday night Bart was very busy in his room.
There were odd noises proceeding from it, and
when he came down a little later, and asked Alice
to sew some strips of red cloth for him, she asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in the world are you up to, Bart?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a knight, getting my armor ready for the
conflict of battle,&rdquo; he replied gravely. &ldquo;Be ready
for me when I return, for I may be covered with
wounds and you can get lots of first-aid-to-the-injured
practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t do anything silly,&rdquo; Alice advised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Far be it from me to do any such thing. You
girls can attend to that part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As if we girls were anywhere near as silly as
boys are when they get started,&rdquo; commented Alice,
sewing away at the cloth. &ldquo;Ouch! There, I&rsquo;ve
pricked my finger!&rdquo; and she wiped away a few
drops of blood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here! Don&rsquo;t get my uniform all spotted!&rdquo;
exclaimed Bart, as he saw Alice wipe her finger
with the red cloth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silly! How is blood going to show on this
old red flannel?&rdquo; asked Alice. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to
wait, Bart, until I wash my finger in an antiseptic
solution,&rdquo; and, laying aside the cloth, Alice hurried
for her little box of remedies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can sew it myself,&rdquo; declared Bart, and he
tried to, but he made awkward work of it, for he
used a five cent piece in place of a thimble, at
which Alice laughed when she returned. Under
her skillful fingers, even though one was done up
in a cloth, the work was soon completed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
It was about two o&rsquo;clock when the pupils were
assembled in the auditorium of the High School
Tuesday afternoon. Professor McCloud delivered
an address on the meaning of Christmas, telling
of how ancient people celebrated it, and relating
stories of the various nations that had beliefs in
myths corresponding to Santa Claus, or St. Nicholas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speaking of Santa Claus,&rdquo; Mr. McCloud went
on, as the closing remarks to his lecture, &ldquo;I am reminded
of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that instant there was a jingle of bells out
in the corridor, and before pupils or teachers, the
latter all sitting on the raised platform in front,
knew what it portended, a strange sight was presented.</p>

<p>Into the big room came a personage dressed in
the usual Santa Claus costume, red flannel striped
with white, a big white beard, his clothing sprinkled
with something to represent snow, and, over
his back a big bag.</p>

<p>But, oddest of all, was a little sleigh which St.
Nicholas pulled in after him by a string. Hitched
in front of it were eight tiny reindeer, made of
plaster-of-paris, properly colored. Each animal
was on a stand on wheels, and as St. Nicholas
pulled them in with the sleigh, he shook the leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
string, on which were bells, so that they jingled
musically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Merry Christmas to all!&rdquo; exclaimed St. Nicholas
in a deep bass voice. &ldquo;May I speak to them,
sir?&rdquo; and the figure turned to Professor McCloud,
who, entering into the spirit of the occasion, nodded
an assent. Neither he nor any of the teachers
were prepared for the advent of Santa Claus.
Some of the boys had suspected, but they were not
sure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My sled and reindeer shrunk as soon as I
struck this climate,&rdquo; Santa Claus went on in his
deep tones, which Ned was puzzling his brain over.
He was wondering where he had heard them before.
&ldquo;Still I managed to come,&rdquo; the red-coated
figure went on. &ldquo;I have a few gifts for some of
the more faithful of my subjects.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He slung the bag from his shoulder and began
groping in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Lem Gordon here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Step up, Lemuel,&rdquo; said Professor McCloud,
for, though he did not know what was coming,
he was willing to let the pupils have fun on such
an occasion as this.</p>

<p>Rather sheepishly Lem, the pitcher on the High
School nine, left his seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard of your good work last season,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Santa Claus went on, &ldquo;and, as a reward for it I
have brought you this. May it help you to win
many games.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that he handed Lem a red, white and blue
striped rubber ball, the kind given to babies so
they can not hurt themselves.</p>

<p>The other pupils burst into laughter, and Lem
blushed. He acted as though he was going to
throw it at the head of St. Nicholas, but thought
better of it and went to his seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fenn Masterson,&rdquo; Santa Claus called next,
and Stumpy went forward. &ldquo;Fenn, I have heard
how devoted you are to the ladies,&rdquo; the speaker
went on. &ldquo;So I bring you this that you may never
forget them,&rdquo; and Fenn was given a doll dressed
in the height of fashion. On the neck was a
card which read: &ldquo;I love Fenn and Fenn loves
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kiss her, Fenn!&rdquo; called out Ned in a loud
whisper, and poor Fenn, blushing to his ears, carried
the doll back to his seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have here something for Ned Wilding,&rdquo; the
figure went on, and, as Ned, in response to the remorseless
urging of his fellow pupils, went forward
he was given a tin rattle box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now James Eaton,&rdquo; called Santa Claus, and
James, who was very fond of dogs was given a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
little woolly one that emitted a squeaky bark when
gently punched in the stomach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;William Sanderson!&rdquo; called St. Nicholas, and
a lad who did little else than fish in his spare time,
was presented with a small pole and line, from
which dangled a tin trout.</p>

<p>So it went on, until a score of the boys and several
girls had been given toy presents bearing on
their particular traits of character.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ned and Fenn had been whispering
to each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I do it now?&rdquo; asked Ned, as St. Nicholas
seemed to have reached the bottom of his bag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; whispered Fenn.</p>

<p>As Santa Claus prepared to leave, thinking perhaps
his identity had not been penetrated, Ned
walked forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; he called, and St. Nicholas
halted in the act of dragging out his tiny reindeer
and sleigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Though you have remembered us, you have
forgotten yourself,&rdquo; Ned went on. &ldquo;Therefore,
Mr. Bart Keene, <i>alias</i> St. Nicholas, on behalf of
the pupils of the school I present you with this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before Bart could get away Ned had torn the
false beard from his chum&rsquo;s face. Then, holding
out what seemed to be a basket-ball, Ned suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
raised it high in the air and brought it
down on Bart&rsquo;s head. It broke with a loud sound,
for it was paper blown up, and out flew a shower
of confetti, which covered Bart&rsquo;s red flannel uniform
with tiny scraps of colored paper. Ned had
brought it to use in playing a joke on someone
else, but, at the last minute, discovering the identity
of St. Nicholas, he had resolved on a different
plan.</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>WRECK OF THE TOWER</h3>


<p>A loud shout of laughter went up at the surprised
look on Bart&rsquo;s face. He did not know
what to say, and he shook his head to get rid of
the confetti that clung even to his eyebrows. He
had hoped to get away undiscovered but his chums
had been too smart for him. He opened his
mouth to speak, and the hickory nut he had placed
in it to make his voice sound deep, dropped out
and rolled on the floor. At this there was more
laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well done, Bart,&rdquo; observed Principal
McCloud. &ldquo;I think school is dismissed,&rdquo; he
added, as he and the other teachers joined in the
laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come again, Bart,&rdquo; said Ned, as he and the
other boys crowded about the impersonator of
Santa Claus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Off with his uniform!&rdquo; one of the boys called,
and, before Bart could defend himself, he was
being pulled this way and that, until the red suit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
he had gone to such trouble to make was a thing
of shreds and tatters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like poor King Lear, being all torn
apart by the winds,&rdquo; exclaimed Jennie Smith,
though some of her companions could not quite
see the simile. &ldquo;Oh, I would love to recite something,&rdquo;
she went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; said Mary Tedwell. &ldquo;I guess
no one will hear you,&rdquo; and she laughed rather
maliciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mean old thing!&rdquo; exclaimed Jennie. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
mad because she can&rsquo;t recite poetry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Bart was entirely stripped of his Santa
Claus suit, and the boys and girls, securing pieces
of it, formed a ring about the lad and marched
around singing any tune that came into their heads.
The teachers had retired, leaving the pupils to
finish in their own fashion the celebration attendant
upon closing of school for the holidays as they
knew there would be little trouble.</p>

<p>But all things must have an end and the merry
frolic of the boys and girls was gradually brought
to a close. Those who had received the odd presents
from Bart were made to exhibit them, and
many were the jibes and quips that accompanied
the display.</p>

<p>On all sides and from scores of girls and boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
came the greeting, &ldquo;Merry Christmas and a Happy
New Year,&rdquo; for school would not assemble again
until the second week in January.</p>

<p>One by one the pupils left for home. The big
auditorium became quieter and soon only the four
chums, Alice and Jennie, and a few of their friends
remained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stand treat for
hot chocolate at Fanton&rsquo;s Drug Emporium.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys and girls were a little later on their
way to the &ldquo;Emporium&rdquo; as the sign in the window
declared it to be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coming to the entertainment Friday night?&rdquo;
asked Jennie of Fenn, when they were sipping the
hot beverage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What entertainment?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Y. M. C. A. is going to give one in the
school auditorium. Moving pictures and some music.
Alice and I are going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure I&rsquo;m coming,&rdquo; Stumpy replied, though it
was the first he had heard of it. But Stumpy
wasn&rsquo;t going to be left out if there were girls
in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where you going?&rdquo; asked Bart, overhearing
the talk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Entertainment&mdash;school hall&mdash;Y. M. C. A.&mdash;Mov&mdash;ing
pict&mdash;ures.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
The breaks Fenn made, in imparting the information,
were caused by the sips of chocolate he
took between his words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all go,&rdquo; decided Bart. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be over
our Christmas dinners by then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finishing their chocolate the boys and girls
walked together down the street on their way home.
As they separated they wished each other the joys
of the season.</p>

<p>Christmas, which came next day, was celebrated
in Darewell much as it is celebrated every where
in Christian lands. There was happiness in the
homes of the four chums, not only at the gifts
which they received, but also over those they gave.
Each one remembered Mrs. Perry and her two
girls, and, it is safe to say, it was the best Christmas
the widow&rsquo;s family had experienced since trouble
came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If only Willie was home now,&rdquo; Mrs. Perry
said to Jane as they looked at the gifts which had
come so unexpectedly to them, &ldquo;we would be very
happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he will be with us next Christmas,&rdquo;
Jane remarked, trying to comfort her mother.
&ldquo;Let us hope so anyhow. We are much more
happy than we were the day before Thanksgiving
when everything seemed so black.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes, thanks to those good boys,&rdquo; the widow
replied. &ldquo;Well, we will trust in Providence.
Perhaps Willie may come back to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The day of the Y. M. C. A. entertainment
proved to be one of the coldest of the winter.
It dawned with a dull leaden sky, filled with lowering
clouds, and there was a nip to the air that
made thick wraps a necessity. The wind, which
had been blowing strongly in the morning, increased
in violence as the day advanced until by
evening it was blowing half a gale.</p>

<p>But the boys and girls who crowded into the
school auditorium did not mind this. It only
made their cheeks redder, and though the wind
did toss and tumble the hair of the girls it only
caused them to look all the prettier, at least so
Fenn thought, and he ought to know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;B-r-r-r! It&rsquo;s a regular hurricane!&rdquo; exclaimed
Bart as he and Alice entered the hall, where they
found a number of their friends. The entertainment
had not yet begun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be getting colder,&rdquo; observed Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What makes you think so?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your nose is as red as a beet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It feels half frozen,&rdquo; Bart answered. &ldquo;That
comes of having such a big one. But it&rsquo;s a sign of
greatness you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
&ldquo;If we let you tell it,&rdquo; interposed Frank.</p>

<p>The hall soon filled up and the entertainment
was started. There was vocal and instrumental
music and recitations. Jennie Smith rendered
&ldquo;Horatius at the Bridge&rdquo; with all the energy she
was capable of, and the four chums applauded vigorously.</p>

<p>The wind was increasing in violence, and it rattled
the windows so that at times it interfered with
the singing. The janitor went about tightening
the fastenings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a bad storm,&rdquo; Bart heard the
man murmur as he adjusted the catches. &ldquo;I hope
it doesn&rsquo;t blow some of the chimneys down. One
or two of &rsquo;em need pointing up, for the mortar&rsquo;s
most out of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any danger?&rdquo; asked Bart in a whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I hope not. The old tower&mdash;&rdquo; but what
the janitor would have said about the tower Bart
did not hear, for the man had passed on and there
came the chorus of a song which drowned his
words.</p>

<p>But the janitor&rsquo;s prophecy seemed likely to be
true. The noise of the wind could be heard more
plainly now. The windows did not rattle so much
after being attended to, but the gale fairly made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the school building vibrate. The old tower the
janitor spoke of was a tall, square affair, at one
corner of the building. It was for ornamental
purposes only, though it contained a large clock,
and there was a winding stair in it that gave access
to the mechanism.</p>

<p>A white screen was adjusted and moving pictures
thrown upon it. The first series was that of battleships
in practice evolutions and as the smoke
rolled from the muzzles of the big guns a man
behind the scenes beat a bass drum, to simulate
the distant roar of the ordnance.</p>

<p>The audience watched one great ship as it came
into view on the screen. A broadside was fired,
and, as the white smoke rolled out there came a
tremendous concussion that shook the entire school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must have busted the drum that time,&rdquo;
thought Bart.</p>

<p>An instant later there came a terrifying crash so
near at hand that everyone knew it was not the
sound of the drum, nor their excited imagination.
Nor was it the noise of the wind.</p>

<p>Then, down through one corner of the auditorium,
fortunately in a place where no one was
seated, crashing through the ceiling, came a mass
of brick and mortar.</p>

<p>Before the echoes of that had died away there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
sounded another noise; a deep, dull sound, and the
school again vibrated with the shock. Then the
auditorium was in darkness, and through it came
the voice of the janitor shouting:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tower has been wrecked and has fallen!&rdquo;</p>

<h3>NED GETS A LETTER</h3>


<p>For an instant silence followed the startling
announcement, silence in which the wind seemed to
join, for there came a lull in the gale. Then, as
the gale resumed its furious blowing, the audience
became fear-crazed and a mad rush ensued.</p>

<p>Women and girls were screaming at the tops of
their voices. Men were shouting to one another
to know what had happened. Boys were darting
here and there seeking a means of escape from
what they believed would prove a death-trap. The
noise of bricks clattering to the floor could be
heard and the school-house seemed, at least to the
excited imaginations of some, to be on the point
of toppling down.</p>

<p>The four chums, who were seated near each
other, had jumped up at the first crash. Bart
reached over to grab Alice and prevent, if possible,
her being trampled under foot. Fenn had Jennie
by the arm. Then the light from the moving picture
machine, which had served to dispel the gloom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
went out. The maddened rush became worse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; cried Frank. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give the school
yell! Maybe it will quiet the rush until we can
turn on the lights! There&rsquo;s a switch on the wall
here! Now, fellows altogether!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His three chums heard him as if in a dream, but
they comprehended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One, two, three!&rdquo; cried Frank.</p>

<p>Then, above the noise of the gale, above the
shrieks of the women and girls, above the hoarse
calls of frightened men, arose the yell, given with
all the power of the lungs of the four boys:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Ravabava&mdash;Havabava&mdash;Hick! Hick! He!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dabavaba&mdash;Nabahaba&mdash;Snick! Snack! Snee!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Why do we thus loudly yell?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&rsquo;Tis for our school: old Darewell!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Never had the call been given under such circumstances.
Never had it sounded more strangely.
Never had it been more welcome.</p>

<p>For an instant there was a silence following the
yell. It had momentarily drowned the cries from
the panic-stricken ones. Before there was a chance
for a continuance of the panic that had been halted,
if only for an instant, Bart cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no danger. Wait until the lights are
turned on!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
In another moment Frank had reached the
switch and the place was brilliant with the gleam
from scores of incandescent lamps. The rush had
been stopped, for, as the crowd looked about, they
saw there was no immediate danger.</p>

<p>In one corner of the auditorium there was a
gaping hole in the roof, where the top part of the
tower had crashed through. The floor in that
section was covered with bricks and mortar, and
several seats were crushed, but the audience had
crowded up front and no one was hurt.</p>

<p>A moment later some of those in charge of the
entertainment hurried to the platform and made an
announcement.</p>

<p>A hasty investigation showed, it was said, that
the tower had fallen mostly outward instead of
toward the school, which accounted for only a
small part of it hitting the roof. Had the entire
pile of masonry toppled over on the auditorium
there might have been a great loss of life. As it
was the main school was in no danger, but, for fear
the structure might have been weakened it was decided
best to dismiss the audience at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That wind must be pretty strong,&rdquo; observed
Bart as he and his chums, with Alice, Jennie, and
some of the other girls, got outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! It certainly is!&rdquo; cried Jennie as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
stepped from the doorway. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m being blown
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wind had caught her long cloak and
whipped it up around her shoulders so that it acted
like a sail. Jennie was being fairly carried along
the street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your chance, Fenn!&rdquo; cried Frank.
&ldquo;Rescue a maiden in distress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fenn did not stop to reply to his tormenter but
caught Jennie by the arm and helped her to
straighten her garment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Noble youth!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart. &ldquo;You shall
be suitably rewarded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all laughed, rather hysterically, it is true,
at the nonsense talk, but it was a relief to their
over-strained nerves for the shock of the accident
had been a severe one.</p>

<p>They passed along and, as they got beyond the
shelter of the school the full force of the wind
was felt. It was almost a hurricane, and it was
all they could do to walk along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No wonder it blew the tower down,&rdquo; observed
Ned. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take a look at the wreck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They walked around to the other side of the
school. There, prone on the ground, though but
a confused mass of bricks and mortar, was what
had been the tower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the clock!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank, as he
saw the dial of the timepiece some distance from
the big mass of masonry. &ldquo;See, it stopped just at
ten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were four dials to the clock, one for each
side of the tower. The dials were of sheet iron
with big gilt hands which were worked simultaneously
by the one set of wheels and springs. This
dial, to which Frank called attention, had fallen
from its place, with the hands still attached to it,
the rods to which they were fastened, and which
served to turn them, having been cut off close to
the back of the face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take it home for a souvenir,&rdquo;
Frank said. &ldquo;If they want it back they can
have it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He picked up the dial, which was painted white
with black numerals on it. As he did so he uttered
an exclamation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all mud, or something black,&rdquo; Frank replied.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it all over my hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better let it alone,&rdquo; advised Bart. &ldquo;The
wind will blow it away, and you with it, if you
try to carry it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I can manage,&rdquo; Frank responded, and
though the gale did get a good purchase on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
flat surface of the dial which was two feet in
diameter, Frank clung to it and took it home with
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See you to-morrow!&rdquo; called Fenn to Frank,
as the latter turned off on a street that led to his
uncle&rsquo;s house. The others went in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come and take a look at the ruins by
daylight,&rdquo; suggested Frank. &ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; called his chums, and the girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Queer sort of a relic he&rsquo;s got,&rdquo; observed
Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like him,&rdquo; Ned rejoined. &ldquo;Frank&rsquo;s
a queer chap anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s nice,&rdquo; remarked Alice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; chimed in Jennie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who said he wasn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; demanded Bart.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t a fellow make a remark about his chum
without being found fault with?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s nice to say he&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; Alice
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why he admits it himself,&rdquo; her brother put
in. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t care what we say about him.
We call him queer about twice a week; don&rsquo;t we
fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; replied Ned, coming to his chum&rsquo;s support.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, never mind,&rdquo; Alice rejoined. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
hurry home or we&rsquo;ll be blown into the next county.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was such a cold blustery night, with the wind
seeming to increase in violence rather than diminish,
that all were glad when they reached their
houses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty fierce gale,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Keene,
when his son and daughter had told him what
had happened, &ldquo;but I wouldn&rsquo;t think it was strong
enough to blow the tower down. Must have been
weak somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The janitor said some of the chimneys needed
new mortar in the cracks, and maybe the tower
did also,&rdquo; Bart said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose the school authorities will investigate
and see what caused it to fall,&rdquo; his father
went on. &ldquo;It was a dangerous thing to let such
a weak tower stay up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bart stopped at Ned&rsquo;s house the next morning
to call for him, and then they intended to get
Frank and Fenn to go together and take a look at
the tower.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on in,&rdquo; Ned invited his chum at the
door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My aunt, Mrs. Paul Kenfield, of New York.
She wants me to come down for a week or two.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
You know, she wrote me some time ago inviting
me for next summer. Now she says she wants
me to come right away, and to bring you three
fellows. I wrote her, after I got the first invitation
that I&rsquo;d like to take my chums with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very kind of you,&rdquo; replied Bart. &ldquo;I
guess I can go. When are you going to start?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will give you a week there. I don&rsquo;t believe
I could get ready so soon. I&rsquo;ve got to help
dad Monday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you and the other boys could come
afterward. Say on Tuesday or Wednesday,&rdquo; suggested
Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think about it,&rdquo; his chum replied. &ldquo;But
come on, let&rsquo;s go take a look at the fallen tower.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>NED STARTS OFF</h3>


<p>Ned and Bart went to Fenn&rsquo;s house, where they
found Frank. The two were just on the point of
starting out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you get your relic home safe?&rdquo; asked
Bart of Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean the clock dial? I did, though I
thought at one time the wind would blow it away.
I got that black stuff whatever it was on it, all
over my clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it paint?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, seemed like some kind of smoke. I had
hard work to get it off my hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; called Fenn. &ldquo;There are
crowds going to see the tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo; asked Ned. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t
carry it away; can they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Fenn, &ldquo;but they&rsquo;ll all get around
it and we can&rsquo;t see anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh we&rsquo;ll get you a pair of opera glasses,&rdquo;
rejoined Frank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re all just as anxious to see it as I
am,&rdquo; said Stumpy. &ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A fine, calm day, though cold, had succeeded
the blustery one. As Fenn had said, the streets
were filled with a large throng hastening to see
the wreck of the tower. The falling of it had
created more excitement than had been known in
Darewell for some years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, you fellows are all right,&rdquo; called Jim
Nelson, as the four chums passed him. &ldquo;That
was a fine yell you gave. I&rsquo;d a joined in, only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too much work, eh?&rdquo; asked Frank, for Jim
had the reputation, not altogether undeserved, of
being the laziest boy in town.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t that exactly,&rdquo; Jim replied, &ldquo;but
I couldn&rsquo;t remember the words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come in on the tune?&rdquo; asked
Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; was all Jim said. It was his usual reply
when he did not want to take the trouble to
answer in words. &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he called a moment
later, as the chums kept on, &ldquo;are you going to the
tower?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; are you?&rdquo; inquired Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was, but if you&rsquo;re going that way would you
do me a favor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
&ldquo;Stop on your way back and tell me how it
looks. No use of me going if you are. I&rsquo;ll wait
in the drug store here for you,&rdquo; and Jim turned
into the &ldquo;Emporium.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We may not be back until late this afternoon,&rdquo;
Fenn said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, I&rsquo;m in no hurry. I can wait
here as well as anywhere else,&rdquo; and Jim went into
the store and took a seat on one of the stools at
the soda fountain, from whence he could look out
of the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if that isn&rsquo;t the limit!&rdquo; exclaimed
Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder he didn&rsquo;t ask us to bring the
tower around for him to look at,&rdquo; said Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He would, only he was too lazy to think of
it,&rdquo; remarked Frank.</p>

<p>The boys found quite a crowd around the fallen
mass of bricks, and many were the comments on
the accident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go up and take a look at where the roof
was broken through,&rdquo; suggested Ned.</p>

<p>The chums started to enter the school intending
to go to the auditorium, but, as they reached the
stairs, for the building was open, they were met
by Mr. Williamson, president of the Board of
Education.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go in, boys,&rdquo; he said pleasantly
enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it dangerous?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re trying to find out.
We have some workmen looking over the ruins
to see what repairs we will have to make. There&rsquo;s
quite a hole in the roof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will it interfere with the opening of school
next week?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you wish it would?&rdquo; asked Mr. Williamson.</p>

<p>The boys laughed, for the president had read
their thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We hope not,&rdquo; Mr. Williamson went on.
&ldquo;By the way, you boys know almost everything
that goes on in Darewell? Did you happen to
hear of any one carrying off one of the clock dials?
We can only find three in the ruins, and there were
four.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I took one home with me last night,&rdquo; said
Frank promptly. &ldquo;I wanted it for a relic. I
hope there was no harm in that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None in the world, if you still have it,&rdquo; said
Mr. Williamson. &ldquo;You see we are trying to find
out just what caused the tower to be blown down
by the wind, and we want all the evidence we can
get. Just keep the dial safely and, the next time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
you come up toward my store, leave it for me.
You may have it back again after we are through
with it, for we&rsquo;ll have to have a whole new clock
I expect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonder what he expects to find from the
clock face?&rdquo; asked Ned, as the boys went back on
the campus to get another look at the fallen tower.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably wants to look into its open countenance
and ask questions about how it feels to be
blown down,&rdquo; Bart replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t any idea they&rsquo;d want that piece of
the clock, or I&rsquo;d never have taken it,&rdquo; said Frank.
&ldquo;Lucky I saved it, or someone else might have
carried it off and they&rsquo;d never get it again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They took another look at the tower, though
there was little they had not already seen, and
then on Stumpy&rsquo;s invitation to have some hot
chocolate they strolled back to the &ldquo;Emporium.&rdquo;
They found Jim still there, but he seemed to have
fallen asleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put some chocolate near him, and see if he
wakes up,&rdquo; suggested Ned in a whisper.</p>

<p>The clerk, at the boys&rsquo; request, placed a glass
of the steaming liquid close to Jim&rsquo;s hand as it
rested on the marble counter. Jim opened his
eyes, looked at the beverage, glanced at the four
chums waiting expectantly and then&mdash;closed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
eyes again without reaching for the chocolate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s lost his chance,&rdquo; Fenn said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drink
it myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did so, and, as the boys were leaving, Jim
appeared to rouse from his slumber. He seemed
to remember the chocolate, for he put out his
hand as if to grasp it. His fingers closed on the
empty air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I drink it?&rdquo; he asked of the chums, who
stood laughing at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must have,&rdquo; replied Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember,&rdquo; Jim said, in puzzled
tones. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;m sleepy to-day.
Is the tower still&mdash;?&rdquo; Then the exertion of
talking seemed to be too much for him, and he
closed his eyes again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Ned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get home
and make arrangements for my New York trip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, and I must find out when I can go,&rdquo;
Bart added. &ldquo;We can have jolly sport there,
fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were several family councils that night.
Ned&rsquo;s plans were all made, and he had but to pack
his trunk, ready to leave on the following Monday
morning. The other chums, though, had to
consult their relatives. It was inconvenient for
some to let the boys go Tuesday, and Thursday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
did not suit any better. Finally a compromise
was made and Wednesday, following the Monday
on which Ned was to start, was fixed on.</p>

<p>Then came an announcement which changed the
plans of the boys to some extent. Late Saturday
afternoon it was stated that the damage to
the school had been greater than was at first supposed.
It would be impossible to make repairs so
that classes might assemble the second week in
January, and the institution was to close for a
month. Not until February first, President Williamson
stated, would the school open again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, this will just suit us!&rdquo; cried Ned as he
and his chums discussed the news that night.
&ldquo;We can stay so much longer. I know my aunt
will be glad to see us, and the longer vacation we
have the better she will like it. She&rsquo;s fond of
boys. All hers are grown up. She said I was to
come and stay a month if I wanted to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to pack
a few more clothes in my trunk if we are to be
gone longer than we first calculated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So will I,&rdquo; cried Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s all settled,&rdquo; said Ned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go
Monday and you follow Wednesday. You can
find your way to the house I guess. It&rsquo;s on West
Forty-fourth street. Here&rsquo;s the number. I&rsquo;ll be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
there to welcome you. Won&rsquo;t we have fun
though! I&rsquo;ve never been in New York.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others had not either, and they spent some
time discussing the pleasant prospects ahead of
them.</p>

<p>Monday morning they all went down to the
depot to see Ned off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye until Wednesday,&rdquo; he called to his
chums as they stood on the platform waving their
hands to him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll meet you in New York sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was a long time before Ned kept his
promise.</p>

<h3>STARTLING NEWS</h3>


<p>The issue of the Darewell <i>Advertiser</i> that
Monday afternoon contained some startling information.
The three chums were standing in front
of the drug store talking of their prospective trip
when a newsboy ran past calling:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Extra! Extra! Full account of the blowing
up of the school tower with dynamite!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that he&rsquo;s yelling?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said something about the school tower
and dynamite,&rdquo; replied Fenn. &ldquo;Trying to sell
his papers I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get one and see if it&rsquo;s a fake,&rdquo; suggested
Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here boy! Give me one!&rdquo; cried Bart, and
the lad handed him a sheet, damp with paste from
the press.</p>

<p>Staring at the three chums in big black letters
was the heading:</p>

<p class="noi center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
SCHOOL TOWER DYNAMITED!<br />
Not Blown Down by Gale of Wind as First<br />
Supposed.<br />
BELIEVED TO BE BOYS&rsquo; WORK!<br />
Investigation Has Been Ordered by President<br />
Williamson of the Board of Education.<br />
FOUR LADS SUSPECTED!<br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think of that!&rdquo; exclaimed
Bart when he had finished reading the head-lines.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that the limit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Limit! It&rsquo;s the strangest thing I ever heard
of,&rdquo; cried Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody has been stuffing the reporter,&rdquo;
suggested Fenn. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s read the rest of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Looking over Bart&rsquo;s shoulders the two other
lads read the account. It told in vivid language
how the fact was discovered that the tower had
been blown down by an explosive. Those nearest
the tower when the crash came told of hearing a
dull boom, that was not caused by the wind. Then
came the sound as the bricks fell through the corner
of the roof of the auditorium.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if other evidence was wanting,&rdquo; the article
went on, &ldquo;it is easily found in the dials of the
clock that was in the tower. The white faces
bear the black marks of powder and an analysis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
which has been made shows the stains to have
been caused by some powerful explosive, the exact
nature of which is being kept secret by the authorities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is understood from a reliable source, however,
that dynamite was used, a small quantity
being placed in the top of the tower. It is said
that part of a dynamite cartridge has been found
but this is denied by the police.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That the work was that of mischievous boys,
who, possibly did not appreciate the seriousness of
their deed, is the opinion of the school authorities.
This is borne out by the fact that a boy confessed
to having carried off one of the powder-marked
dials of the clock. Why he did this has not been
disclosed, but Mr. Williamson has secured an admission
from him that he did take the dial from
the debris of the wrecked tower. This dial the
president of the board has secured, together with
the other three.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is alleged that four boys, who are often
seen in each others&rsquo; company, and who have, before
this, taken part in more or less harmless
tricks, are suspected of blowing down the tower.
One of them, it can be asserted on the highest
authority, had the clock dial. An investigation
has been started by the school authorities, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
four boys in question, including the one who took
the dial from the wreckage, will be called on to
tell what they know. If the evidence, after a
thorough sifting, points to them, it is understood
that criminal action will be taken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear the like?&rdquo; cried Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, here&rsquo;s something more,&rdquo; said Bart. He
pointed to a few lines of type at the bottom of
the article. They read:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as we are going to press we learn that
one of the four suspected lads has hurriedly left
town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; cried Bart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make
him take that back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make who take what back?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why the editor of this paper. Can&rsquo;t you see
who he&rsquo;s referring to in that last line? He means
Ned! He means that Ned&rsquo;s run away for fear
he&rsquo;ll be arrested! He means us when he says
&lsquo;four boys often seen in each others&rsquo; company!&rsquo;
He&rsquo;s accusing the Darewell Chums of blowing up
the tower! Come on, we&rsquo;ll make him deny this
if he has to get out an extra!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go slow,&rdquo; advised Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go slow! Yes, that&rsquo;s always your way!
Wait and let him say all he wants to about us! I
guess not!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
&ldquo;I say we&rsquo;d better wait,&rdquo; Frank went on
quietly. &ldquo;Of course you know, and I know, none
of us had anything to do with the blowing up of
the tower. I don&rsquo;t believe it was blown up. I
believe the wind did it, and some one has imagined
all this and given the reporter a story of what he
thinks is the truth. At the same time the school
authorities may be going to have an investigation.
It&rsquo;s their privilege. Now if we go to the editor&rsquo;s
office and raise a row folks at once will jump to
the conclusion that we had some hand in the explosion.
Besides, it doesn&rsquo;t say we are suspected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It as good as says so,&rdquo; Bart exclaimed.
&ldquo;Everyone will know they mean us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the same time the article doesn&rsquo;t say so.
That editor is cute enough for that. He doesn&rsquo;t
want a libel suit on his hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might as well call us by the names,&rdquo; Bart
insisted. &ldquo;Besides, that refers to Ned as plain
as can be, and he isn&rsquo;t here to defend himself.
It&rsquo;s our duty to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you you&rsquo;ll only make things worse if
you go to the office of the paper,&rdquo; Frank insisted.
&ldquo;The editor will ask you if you think the article
refers to you. You&rsquo;ll say it does, and he&rsquo;ll say, in
effect, &lsquo;if the shoe fits put it on.&rsquo; These newspaper
men are no fools. They have some basis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
for what they write. Besides, you know I did
take the dial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you did,&rdquo; said Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you give it back to Mr. Williamson?&rdquo;
asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I took it to the store as he asked me to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t make any admissions, did
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could I? There were none to make.
You were with me when he asked me about the
clock face and you heard all I said. When I left
the dial in the store he was not there. I haven&rsquo;t
seen him since. The reporter is drawing on his
imagination I guess for considerable of this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if they are going to have an investigation?&rdquo;
said Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and see Mr. Williamson,&rdquo; suggested
Fenn. &ldquo;We can show him the article and he can
tell us what to do. I think that&rsquo;s the best plan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other two chums agreed to this, and, each
one having purchased a paper containing the startling
news, they went to the hardware store of the
president of the Board of Education.</p>

<p>Mr. Williamson was talking to some other
members of the board, in his private office, when
the boys entered the store. They sent word they
wanted to see him, and in a little while, his visitors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
having gone, the president invited the chums in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;what can I do for
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This article,&rdquo; began Bart. &ldquo;It seems to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have read it,&rdquo; Mr. Williamson interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suspect us?&rdquo; demanded Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is hardly a fair question,&rdquo; Mr. Williamson
replied. &ldquo;I shall probably be called upon to
preside at the investigation and I can not discuss
the case in advance of the hearing. I will say
this however: We believe some boy or boys blew
up the tower, little thinking of the terrible danger
to which he subjected the entire school and that
audience. We have no direct evidence, as yet,
but we expect to get some. I may add that a
hearing will be held to-night, and I would like
you boys to be there. I understand Ned Wilding
has gone to New York.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He went this morning,&rdquo; replied Bart, &ldquo;but
he had planned to go long before this thing happened.
We are going to join him Wednesday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; and Mr. Williamson looked a little
surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What time is the hearing?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At eight o&rsquo;clock, in my office here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be on hand,&rdquo; spoke Bart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
All the members of the Board of Education,
the school janitor, the chief of police, a detective,
the fathers of Bart and Fenn, and Frank&rsquo;s uncle
were at the hearing. There was much testimony
in an informal way, to the effect that the tower
was wrecked by an explosion and not by the
wind. So much was easily proved.</p>

<p>The next thing was to discover who had done
the deed. The janitor said he had seen a boy
hanging around the tower just before the entertainment
began, but he could not give a good description.
It might fit half the boys in Darewell.</p>

<p>There was no direct evidence against the chums.
Bart had bought some powder in Mr. Williamson&rsquo;s
store a few days before the explosion, but
he testified it was for his gun, which evidence was
corroborated by Mr. Keene. The taking away
of the clock dial by Frank was dwelt upon, and
there seemed a disposition to make much of it, but
the boy&rsquo;s uncle bore out Frank&rsquo;s statement that
the dial had been placed among a lot of other
relics and ornaments in his nephew&rsquo;s room, and
was not hidden away as though Frank wished to
conceal any evidence. Ned&rsquo;s sudden trip was explained,
though it was manifest that some of the
school commissioners looked with disfavor on it.</p>

<p>The affair ended, as far as the four chums<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
were concerned, in a sort of Scotch verdict of &ldquo;not
proven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does that end this inquiry?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Keene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the time being,&rdquo; replied Mr. Williamson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I demand that this committee issue a
statement that there is not the slightest evidence
against my son and his chums.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will do nothing of the sort!&rdquo; exclaimed
Mr. Williamson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I shall take legal steps to compel you
to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I will join you,&rdquo; declared Mr. Masterson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This investigation will be continued later,&rdquo;
Mr. Williamson went on. &ldquo;We have not finished.
We are going to have some expert detectives
here. Then perhaps we shall discover who
perpetrated this outrage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may rest assured it was none of these
boys,&rdquo; said Mr. Dent. &ldquo;I know my nephew and
I know his chums too well even to suspect them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all at present,&rdquo; the president of the
board remarked. &ldquo;The meeting is adjourned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it leaves these boys under a cloud,&rdquo; objected
Mr. Keene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry but that cannot be helped,&rdquo; was
Mr. Williamson&rsquo;s reply.</p>

<h3>NED&rsquo;S BUSINESS VENTURE</h3>


<p>Meanwhile Ned Wilding was speeding on the
fast train toward New York. The first part of the
journey was no novelty to him, as he had been
over that part of the line before. Soon, however,
he noticed a change in the scenery and was kept
busy watching the landscape as it seemed to fly
past the windows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if I&rsquo;ll have time to attend to that
little matter of business before I go to Uncle
Kenfield&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; said Ned to himself as he leaned
back in his seat and pulled a bundle of papers
from his pocket. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what the address is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned began to turn over the pages of a booklet
which he selected from among his bundle of
documents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Skem &amp; Skim, 111 Broadway,&rdquo; he read.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just drop down there before I go to uncle&rsquo;s
house and buy my stock. Just think of me being
a stockholder in the Mt. Olive Oil Well Corporation,
Limited. Capital ten million dollars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
surplus and undivided profits five millions. It
must be a great concern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned gave himself up to pleasant thoughts and
looked out of the window. Perhaps he saw himself
a millionaire riding in his private car. For
Ned was going to do some business on his own
account&mdash;the first he had ever done.</p>

<p>When he learned that he was to visit his aunt
and uncle in New York he decided to put into
operation a plan he had long had in mind; ever
since, in fact, he got the thousand dollars damages
which were paid to him and his chums by Mr.
Ricka, as told in the first volume of this &ldquo;Darewell
Chums Series.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Wilding, after much solicitation on Ned&rsquo;s
part, had allowed his son to take one hundred
dollars of the money to invest in any way he saw
fit, subject to certain restrictions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not let you buy gold bricks with it, of
course,&rdquo; Mr. Wilding had said, &ldquo;and I advise
you not to invest it in alleged counterfeit money
or &lsquo;green goods.&rsquo; But anything else in reason
you may do. It&rsquo;s your first real business venture,
and it will be good for you to learn by experience.
I had to when I was a boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about buying oil stock?&rdquo; Ned had
asked. &ldquo;I have been reading that up lately.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Mr. Wilding smiled behind the paper he was
reading.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I warned you against gold bricks,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but this is a legitimate oil business,&rdquo; Ned
replied. &ldquo;The company advertises in the best
magazines, and is only selling stock low for a few
days. By February first it is going to five dollars
a share. It&rsquo;s only fifty cents now. Why, they
have testimonials from prominent men, and an
expert writes that the oil wells of the Mt. Olive
concern are the richest ever seen. They have
one well that runs a hundred barrels a day and
they haven&rsquo;t it half bored yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ned,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilding, and he spoke a little
gravely, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to stand in your way.
I&rsquo;ve allowed you to take that hundred dollars to
invest as you please. Now I&rsquo;m not going to advise
you. If I did I might as well invest the
money myself. I want you to learn to be a business
man and the best way to learn is by experience,
though it isn&rsquo;t always the easiest way.
If you want to buy stock in that oil company do
so. If you get &lsquo;bitten&rsquo; you do so with your eyes
open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s a good investment,
father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to say. Sometimes those concerns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
pay well, and again they do not. It&rsquo;s an
operation such as business men enter into every
day, and in this case, as far as you are concerned,
it is legitimate, since you are going to buy the stock
outright, and not speculate in it by buying on a
margin. As I said, I will not advise you. Buy
that stock if you want to, and I&rsquo;ll say nothing
which ever way the cat jumps. It&rsquo;s your money
and you will have to foot the bill. I wouldn&rsquo;t
risk more than a hundred dollars though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will give me two hundred shares at fifty
cents each,&rdquo; Ned replied, figuring on the back of
an envelope. &ldquo;If it goes to five dollars a share
I&rsquo;ll make nine hundred dollars profit. That
would be fine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve decided to buy it, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so. I&rsquo;ll get it when I go to New
York to Uncle Kenfield&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, Ned. You may do so. Only remember
one thing, just repeat to yourself that old
proverb about counting your chickens before
they&rsquo;re hatched.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I may not make nine hundred dollars,
but I&rsquo;m bound to clear some profit. The
stock can&rsquo;t go much below fifty cents a share,&rdquo;
Ned remarked hopefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your lookout,&rdquo; his father replied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
&ldquo;Now that you&rsquo;ve got it settled I&rsquo;ll draw a hundred
dollars of your thousand and give it to you
before you start for New York.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was this transaction Ned had in mind as he
was on his way to the great city. He read the
account of the oil concern from circulars which
had been mailed to him in Darewell a few weeks
ago. There were big sheets of statistics, prospectuses
glittering with gold printing, finely engraved
sample stock certificates and a mass of
figures that showed the impossibility of the Mt.
Olive oil wells producing any less than the highest
possible number of barrels per day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If this turns out all right I&rsquo;ll get the other
boys to invest some of their money,&rdquo; Ned said to
himself.</p>

<p>Ned reached New York safely about noon. He
had his dinner in a restaurant near the station and
then, leaving his trunk until he could have it sent
to his uncle&rsquo;s house, and carrying only a small
valise, he went to the office of the oil concern.</p>

<p>He had little difficulty in finding it, once a policeman
had directed him to Broadway. He was
hardly prepared for the beautifully furnished office
into which he stepped. There was heavy carpet
on the floor, the chandeliers, glowing with electric
lights, seemed of solid gold. There were brass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and mahogany railings, big rosewood desks, telephones
on the desks, stock tickers clicking in one
corner, and three girls clicking on typewriters in
another corner. On every side were evidence of
a big and rushing business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, what can we do for you? Who are
you from?&rdquo; asked a clerk, from behind a brass
grating, as Ned entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came to buy some stock,&rdquo; the boy replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who for? Speak quick! This is our busy
day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For myself,&rdquo; Ned replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, no joking. I haven&rsquo;t any time to
waste. Got an order from a broker? Hand it
over with the check.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any order and I haven&rsquo;t any check,&rdquo;
Ned made reply, somewhat sharply, for the clerk&rsquo;s
manner nettled him. &ldquo;I came in here to buy some
stock on my own account. I&rsquo;ve got the cash here,
but if you don&rsquo;t want&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked a large, pompous man,
with a florid face and a white moustache, coming
from an inner office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This boy says he wants to buy some stock,&rdquo;
the clerk replied.</p>

<p>The florid man looked at Ned sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean this gentleman comes in here to invest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
in the Mt. Olive Oil Well Corporation,&rdquo; the
florid man went on quickly. &ldquo;Certainly, my dear
sir,&rdquo; and he shot a meaning look at the clerk.
&ldquo;Skem &amp; Skim will be happy to transact any business
you may entrust them with. Step in here,
please,&rdquo; and he held the door open for Ned to
enter the inner office.</p>

<p>That was even more richly furnished than the
outer one. Ned sat in an upholstered chair that
seemed to smother him, so far down did it let him
sink.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my dear sir, what can we do for you?&rdquo;
and the man looked at Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a hundred dollars to invest in your oil
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man seemed a little disappointed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum, yes, of course. Well, at the present
market rate that will give you two hundred shares.
You are in luck, my dear sir. We are going to
put the price at a dollar a share in the morning.
In fact we were going to advance it this afternoon.
I will have your certificate made out at once.&rdquo; He
took the money, which Ned held out, and touched
a button on his desk. A young man entered.
&ldquo;Make out a certificate for two hundred shares
for this gentleman, er&mdash;let&rsquo;s see&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid I
didn&rsquo;t catch your name when you mentioned it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
As Ned had not mentioned it the gentleman&rsquo;s
inability to catch it might easily be forgiven.</p>

<p>Ned supplied the necessary information, and
the clerk withdrew. Another entered a moment
later. He seemed much excited:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just had a wire from Colonel Janders,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;The Black Cat well has increased fifty
barrels a day, Mr. Skem!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed the florid gentleman.
&ldquo;Tell Mr. Skim at once, and put the stock up to
a dollar a share. You got in just in time,&rdquo; he
added, turning to Ned, and our hero thought so
himself.</p>

<p>As the last clerk withdrew another one came in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got an order from Mr. Johnson for five
thousand shares,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Shall I let
him have &rsquo;em at fifty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry to disoblige Mr. Johnson, who is a
very good friend of mine,&rdquo; said Mr. Skem, &ldquo;but
I shall have to charge him a dollar. I guess he&rsquo;ll
pay it. The stock will go to two dollars a share
before the end of the week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first clerk came back with a finely engraved
certificate, on which the name &ldquo;Edward Wilding&rdquo;
was written in a flourishing hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; said Mr. Skem. &ldquo;I hope
you will take some more stock soon. If you invest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
before the end of the week I will, as a special
favor to you, make the price seventy-five cents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned had half a mind to invest another hundred
dollars, but he thought he had better write to his
father first. Then, with the precious certificate in
his pocket, he started for his uncle&rsquo;s house,
planning to stop on the way and order his trunk
sent up.</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>IN TROUBLE</h3>


<p>By inquiring from a policeman Ned found
which elevated road to take in order to get to his
uncle&rsquo;s residence. As he found the station was
close to the office of the oil company, he decided
he would go direct to Mr. Kenfield&rsquo;s home and
arrange later to have his trunk sent up. He knew
his uncle had a telephone, and thought the baggage
could be sent for by an order over the wire. This
would save him a long trip back to the station.</p>

<p>When Ned reached the address on West Forty-fourth
street he was admitted by a maid, who
asked him whom he wished to see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is my uncle in?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, so you&rsquo;re the little lad from Darewell,&rdquo;
the girl exclaimed, with a smile, though Ned did
not think he quite came under the category of
&ldquo;little.&rdquo; The maid asked him to come in and,
as soon as he entered the hall, he saw that the
place was in confusion. Several trunks stood
about, some half full, others empty, while on chairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and sofas in the reception hall and parlor were
piles of clothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is anything the matter?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Kenfield has suddenly been called to
Europe,&rdquo; the girl said. &ldquo;He has to go aboard
the steamer to-night, and he must pack up at once.
He has gone down town on a matter of business
but he&rsquo;ll soon be back. Your aunt is expecting
you. She&rsquo;s upstairs. I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl led Ned to Mrs. Kenfield&rsquo;s room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ned, I had forgotten all about you!&rdquo;
his aunt exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad to see you, but
I&rsquo;m sorry we&rsquo;re so upset. However, it will be
over in a few hours, and when your uncle is off on
the steamer you and I can sit down and talk. I
want you to tell me all about Darewell and how
your father is. I haven&rsquo;t seen him in so long!
My! but you&rsquo;re the perfect image of him. How
are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, aunt,&rdquo; Ned replied. &ldquo;Can I do
anything to help you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we are almost packed, or, rather your
uncle is. He has to take quite a lot of things, as
he doesn&rsquo;t know how long he may have to stay.
Now, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I&rsquo;ll see about another
trunk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Kenfield returned to the house in about an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
hour and warmly welcomed his nephew. He expressed
regret at the necessity which so unexpectedly
called him abroad, and said his trip could not
be postponed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you will have a good time with your
aunt,&rdquo; he added with a smile. &ldquo;She knows as
much about New York as I do, and will have
more opportunities to take you around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I had better telegraph the other boys
not to come,&rdquo; suggested Ned. &ldquo;It may inconvenience
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; let them come and welcome!&rdquo; exclaimed
Mrs. Kenfield. &ldquo;I love boys. We&rsquo;ll
have a fine time. I have lots of room, and I
want you and your chums to enjoy this visit to
New York.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night Mr. Kenfield, bidding his wife and
nephew good-bye, went aboard the vessel which
was to sail early in the morning to take advantage
of the tide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose your uncle is well out on the
ocean by this time,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Kenfield, after
a somewhat late breakfast which she and Ned
ate alone in the handsome dining room. &ldquo;Now,
Ned, will you excuse me for a few hours? I
have some shopping to do, and I know you
wouldn&rsquo;t want to be going through the stores while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
I stop at the bargain counters,&rdquo; and she laughed.
&ldquo;Try and make yourself at home here. Mary
will get lunch for you, in case I am not back in
time. To-morrow your chums will be here, and
we must plan to entertain them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned said he would be glad to take a rest during
the morning, and, after his aunt had left he went
to the library to read. He could not get interested
in books, however, with the big city of New York
at hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go out and get a paper, and see
how my oil stock is getting along,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s advanced some more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Telling Mary, the maid, where he was going,
and remarking that he would soon be back, Ned
went out into the street. It was rather cold, but
the sun was shining brightly and most of the snow
had been cleared away. Ned got a paper and
turned to the financial page. There, sure enough
was the name, Mt. Olive Oil, and it was quoted at
one dollar a share. Ned did not notice that it
was in the column of &ldquo;unlisted securities,&rdquo; together
with other stock of corporations, some selling
as low as ten cents a share.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting rich,&rdquo; Ned murmured to himself.
&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll take another look at that certificate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pulled it from his pocket, and, as he stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
in the street reading it over he suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve made a mistake. It&rsquo;s only for one
hundred shares instead of two hundred. I must
go right down to the office and have it straightened
out. It&rsquo;s probably a clerical error.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though he said this to himself, it was with a
vague feeling of uneasiness that Ned boarded a
car to go to the offices of Skem &amp; Skim. It must
be an error, he repeated to himself, over and over
again. Still he remembered what his father had
said about &ldquo;fake&rdquo; companies. But this one had
seemed substantial, and their offices certainly indicated
that they did a big business. Ned was deposited
by the elevator in the corridor opposite the
glittering offices of Skem &amp; Skim. He observed
a number of persons standing before the entrance
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you I will go in!&rdquo; Ned heard one excited
man exclaim. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got a thousand
dollars of my money and I want it back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and they&rsquo;ve got five hundred of mine,&rdquo;
another man chimed in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, gentlemen,&rdquo; replied a third voice.
&ldquo;But the offices are closed. No one can go in
until after an investigation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By whose orders are they closed?&rdquo; asked the
man who had mentioned the thousand dollars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
&ldquo;By the orders of the United States postal authorities,&rdquo;
was the answer. &ldquo;A fraud order has
been issued against Skem &amp; Skim, and there is a
warrant for their arrest on a charge of using the
mails to swindle. They skipped out just before
we got here this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we get our money?&rdquo; inquired half a
dozen anxious ones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; was the reply from a small
but determined looking man who stood before the
door. &ldquo;My assistant and I have charge of the
offices. As soon as we can learn anything definite
we will let you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did they both get away?&rdquo; asked some one
of the postoffice inspector, for such the man in
charge was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, both Skem and Skim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Their names ought to be Scheme and Skin,&rdquo;
said a man in a corner. &ldquo;They skinned me out
of three hundred dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any chance of getting &rsquo;em?&rdquo; was the next inquiry
of the inspector.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We hope so. We are also looking for a
young fellow who is supposed to hold two hundred
shares of this wild-cat oil stock in the Mt. Olive
well. As far as we can learn he is the only stockholder
outside of Skem &amp; Skim, and of course he&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
liable if there&rsquo;s any money in the concern. He
may have a lot of the cash, which the firm got on
other deals, salted away somewhere. He&rsquo;s the
one we want as badly as we do the other two. A
young chap too, but as slick as they make &rsquo;em I&rsquo;m
told, even if he is a stranger here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned listened in wonder. He thought of his
two hundred shares, and of the certificate in his
pocket. He wondered if, by any possibility, he
could be the one wanted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is this young fellow?&rdquo; some one in the
crowd asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;d like to find out,&rdquo; the inspector
replied. &ldquo;He only got into New York
yesterday, so one of my detectives informs me.
Came from up state, or out west I hear. He&rsquo;s
the one I want, for he can tell a lot about this
business. If I can lay hands on him I&rsquo;ll clap him
into a cell quicker than he can say Jack Robinson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if he can mean me?&rdquo; Ned thought,
and his heart beat rapidly. &ldquo;I came from up
state yesterday. I got into New York yesterday,
and I have two hundred shares of the Mt. Olive
stock&mdash;at least I paid for &rsquo;em. But I don&rsquo;t know
any more about this business than the man in the
moon. Still they may not believe me. I wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
if they would arrest me? Maybe it was against
the law to buy the stock of a fraudulent concern.
I wonder what I&rsquo;d better do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; the inspector went on, speaking to
the angry and defrauded investors, &ldquo;once let me
get my hands on this young fellow who has those
two hundred shares and I&rsquo;ll clear up some of this
mystery. He and Skem &amp; Skim worked the trick
among themselves and now you gentlemen can
whistle for your money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to get one chance at that young fellow!&rdquo;
exclaimed the man who had lost the thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So would I!&rdquo; chimed in the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t even give me an opportunity
to explain,&rdquo; thought Ned. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d lock me up
at once, though I&rsquo;m entirely innocent. I&rsquo;m going
to get away from here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, while the angry men were still talking to
the postal inspector, Ned turned and hurried off.
He was afraid to go down in the elevator lest the
attendant might recognize him as the youth who
was at the offices the day before, so he walked
down the ten flights of stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must hurry and tell my aunt all about it,&rdquo;
Ned thought. &ldquo;She will know what I ought to
do.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>ADRIFT IN NEW YORK</h3>


<p>Puzzled, worried and not a little frightened at
what the outcome of his investment might be,
Ned boarded an elevated train for his aunt&rsquo;s home.
He was sure the inspector had referred to him,
and, though he knew he had done nothing wrong,
yet he admitted he was ignorant of the laws regarding
stocks and bonds, and might have, unknowingly,
acted illegally.</p>

<p>He had read of cases where the stockholders in
a fraudulent concern were liable for the corporation&rsquo;s
debts, and, in fancy, he saw a suit started
against himself. As he was a minor he thought
his father would have to stand the damage. Poor
Ned was in a highly nervous state when he went
up the steps of his aunt&rsquo;s home.</p>

<p>He began to imagine there might be a policeman
waiting for him in the hall. He looked
around as he reached the front door, expecting to
see a blue-coated officer close at his heels. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
there was a general alarm sent out for him he felt
positive.</p>

<p>Something in Mary&rsquo;s manner, as she opened the
door in response to his ring, told him there was
trouble in the house. The girl&rsquo;s eyes showed she
had been crying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Master Ned!&rdquo; she exclaimed as he entered.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it awful! To think of the trouble!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how did you hear?&rdquo; asked the boy,
wondering if in the parlor there was an officer to
arrest him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, &rsquo;twas a message we got, to be sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the postoffice authorities sent a letter
here?&rdquo; asked Ned, somewhat relieved to find he
would not have to break to his aunt what he believed
would be terrible news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Kenfield called down from
the head of the stairs. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a letter from
the postoffice, it was a telegram. I have received
bad news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, aunt, it wasn&rsquo;t my fault at all!&rdquo; burst
out Ned. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know about it, or I&rsquo;d never
have come to New York.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it isn&rsquo;t your fault,&rdquo; his aunt said.
&ldquo;How could you know about it when I only got
the telegram myself a little while ago? As for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
your coming to New York, that couldn&rsquo;t be helped.
Of course it&rsquo;s too bad. But you can pay me another
visit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned thought she meant he must hurry away to
escape arrest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you almost packed up, Mrs. Kenfield?&rdquo;
asked Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, almost. I shall want a little help. I
must go at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;what&mdash;are you&mdash;I don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;&rdquo;
began Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, just like women, to begin at the
wrong end,&rdquo; said Mrs. Kenfield, and Ned&rsquo;s heart
beat fast. He wondered if his aunt was going to
reproach him for bringing disgrace on the family.
He thought she would have to flee the city too,
in order to avoid arrest. How he wished his
uncle was at home to advise and help them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you have to go, aunt?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
I let &rsquo;em take me? I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s very good of you to offer, Ned. But
I must go. They need me to help nurse her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help nurse,&rdquo; repeated Ned, wondering if he
had heard aright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, didn&rsquo;t Mary tell you? We have just
received a telegram from my niece Jane Alden in
Chicago. She has typhoid fever and I must go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
to her at once. She has no other relatives living
and I must take care of her. I shall have to start
at once and, as there is no telling when I will
come back I must close up the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Close up the house,&rdquo; Ned said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it will make lots of trouble, and I am
so sorry that it will spoil the pleasure of yourself
and your chums. But there is no help for it. I
think you had better go back home, Ned. You
and your friends can come and spend two months
here next summer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Mary going too?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mary is going to stay with some relatives in
Long Island until I come back. I have sent a
cablegram explaining matters to your uncle and it
will be waiting for him when his ship arrives on
the other side. Oh, poor dear Jane! I hope her
case is not a severe one. It is lucky I know how
to nurse. She never could get along without me.
I am sorry for you, Ned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned felt sorry for himself but he did not feel
like inflicting his own troubles on his aunt. Still
he did want some instructions about what he had
better do. He was all upset and did not know
whether to go home at once or wait until his aunt
had started. He half resolved to tell her what
had happened and ask her advice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
&ldquo;Maybe she can send me to uncle&rsquo;s lawyer and
he can help me,&rdquo; he said to himself. His aunt
came downstairs at that moment and he decided
to make an attempt to gain an idea of how to
proceed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know anything about stocks, aunt?&rdquo;
asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stocks? Mercy, no! I leave all that to your
uncle. I have trouble enough&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door bell rang and Mrs. Kenfield opened
it. A boy handed her a telegram. Her hands
shook as she opened it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jane is worse,&rdquo; she said as she read the second
brief dispatch. &ldquo;I must hurry off soon. Now
Ned, I can&rsquo;t tell you how sorry I am, but you had
better arrange to go home at once. I will take
the noon train for Chicago. What time can you
get one back to Darewell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At four this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you had better take it. Mary, hurry
packing those trunks. Then get your own things
ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine are all packed, Mrs. Kenfield,&rdquo; the girl
replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right then. See that the house is well
locked up. Don&rsquo;t leave any victuals around where
they will spoil. Shut all the blinds and fasten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the windows well. You can go any time you are
ready, Mary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was going to the station with you and help
you carry your valise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ned can do that. His train doesn&rsquo;t go until
four o&rsquo;clock; can&rsquo;t you, Ned?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, aunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned&rsquo;s chance to ask advice was gone for, following
the receipt of the second telegram, his aunt
was so excited about getting ready that he had no
heart to bother her with his affair. He started
every time the door bell rang, fearing the police
might have traced him to his aunt&rsquo;s house and
would arrest him at any moment.</p>

<p>An expressman, who had been telephoned for,
took two trunks belonging to Mrs. Kenfield.
They were to go to Chicago. Mary&rsquo;s was also
shipped to her friends in Long Island. Ned was
glad he had left his at the depot, as it could be
checked back to his home from there.</p>

<p>Mary departed about ten o&rsquo;clock. The house
had been darkened by the closing of the shutters
so that it was necessary to light the gas. Mrs.
Kenfield went about making sure that all the doors
were fastened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how sorry I am,&rdquo; she said to
Ned. &ldquo;To think of your holiday being spoiled!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that, aunt,&rdquo; said the boy.
&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In fact he was thinking less about his broken
holiday than he was about his own plight in the
stock transaction. He felt the certificate rustle
in his pocket when he moved, and he had half a
mind to throw it away. But he feared lest doing
that, even with the tearing of it into small bits,
might lead to his discovery. He was too worried
and excited to be able to think clearly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we are all ready,&rdquo; his aunt remarked
as she stood in the hall. She had a small valise to
carry, and Ned had the one he had brought from
home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be sure and explain to your father how it
happened,&rdquo; Mrs. Kenfield said. &ldquo;Tell him about
your uncle&rsquo;s unexpected trip to Europe and about
Jane Alden. He knew her quite well when he
was a young man. Now I guess we will start. I
like to be in plenty of time for my train. I hate
to hurry at the last minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Together they left the house, Ned carrying both
valises. They boarded the elevated which ran
near Mrs. Kenfield&rsquo;s house and were soon on their
way to the station where Ned&rsquo;s aunt was to take
her train.</p>

<p>The boy saw her safely aboard and bade her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
good-bye. She told him to write to her, and gave
him her Chicago address.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell your chums how sorry I was to disappoint
them,&rdquo; she called to Ned as her train rolled
out of the depot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; replied Ned.</p>

<p>Then, left alone as he was in the big city, he felt
a sense of fear, and hardly knew what to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;d better go straight back to Darewell
and tell dad all about it,&rdquo; he said to himself.</p>

<p>He was soon in the station at which he had
arrived the day previous, and where he had left
his trunk. As he was going to the baggage room,
to have it rechecked to Darewell, he caught sight
of a man who seemed strangely familiar to him.
The man had his back toward Ned, but when he
turned the boy saw it was the postal inspector who
had been at the offices of Skem &amp; Skim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s after me!&rdquo; thought Ned. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s on
my track! I must not let him see me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned suddenly away so the man could not
observe his face. The inspector was talking to a
policeman, and Ned overheard the bluecoat ask:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you sent the telegram?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;ll be on the watch for him if he
goes back home,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll nab
him as soon as he gets off the train. If he calls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
for his baggage the agent here will hold him and
notify me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned hurried from the depot and ran up the
street as if the officer was after him. The last
way of escape seemed closed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>THE CHUMS ARRIVE</h3>


<p>Darewell never had known such excitement
as followed the destruction of the school tower.</p>

<p>Of course all the doings in Mr. Williamson&rsquo;s
store leaked out, and, though there were not lacking
those who accused the four chums of, at least,
knowing something about the matter, there were
others who felt sure they had had nothing to do
with it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just wish I had a chance to nurse that mean
Mr. Williamson!&rdquo; exclaimed Alice, when her
brother had told her of the hearing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d fix
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d cover him with the hottest mustard plasters
I could make, and I&rsquo;ve got a good formul
for some powerful ones. Then I&rsquo;d fasten &rsquo;em on
with bandages so they couldn&rsquo;t come off. The
idea of accusing you boys!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t exactly accuse us,&rdquo; said Bart.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trouble. If he did we could demand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
a legal trial and be found not guilty in short order.
As it is we&rsquo;re suspected and can&rsquo;t prove our innocence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are they going to do about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why nothing at present, and I&rsquo;m glad of it.
Frank, Fenn, and I are going to New York
Wednesday and we don&rsquo;t care what they do until
we come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Bart, doesn&rsquo;t that look like running
away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what it looks like. It&rsquo;s the first
chance we have ever had of going to a big city
like that and we may never have another, so we&rsquo;re
going. They can talk all they want to, and fix the
tower up to suit themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the preparations Bart and his two chums
made for their journey to New York, one would
have thought they were going to Europe. They
were at the station about an hour ahead of train
time Wednesday morning, and a number of their
boy friends were present to see them off. Going
to New York was somewhat of a novelty in Darewell,
especially when three boys went at once to
visit the rich aunt of another local lad.</p>

<p>Amid a chorus of good-byes the boys got aboard
and soon they were speeding toward the big city.
They arrived at the same depot where Ned had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
left the train two days before, and looked around
for a possible sight of their chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was he going to meet us here?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he said we were to go right to his aunt&rsquo;s
house,&rdquo; replied Fenn. &ldquo;Bart has the address;
haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, on Forty-fourth street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;East or west?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither one, just plain Forty-fourth street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he said east,&rdquo; Fenn remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it was west,&rdquo; Frank replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s flip a coin,&rdquo; said Fenn. &ldquo;Heads is east
and tails is west.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It came down heads, and, following a policeman&rsquo;s
directions they started for that section of
the city. They reached it, after no little trouble
for they took the wrong car once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t look like a very nice neighborhood,&rdquo;
said Fenn as they started along East Forty-fourth
street. &ldquo;Still I guess New York is so crowded
you can&rsquo;t have much of a choice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They found the number on East Forty-fourth
street, but at the first sight of the big apartment
house they knew they had made a mistake, since
Ned had told them his aunt lived in a house all
to herself, which is quite a distinction in New
York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
&ldquo;Now for the other side of the city,&rdquo; said
Frank, as after diligent inquiry, they learned Mrs.
Kenfield did not live in the neighborhood they
first tried. They boarded a car and were soon at
Ned&rsquo;s uncle&rsquo;s home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks as if it was shut up,&rdquo; remarked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope we haven&rsquo;t made another mistake,&rdquo;
said Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the right number and it&rsquo;s the right street,&rdquo;
replied Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and Mrs. Kenfield lives here,&rdquo; put in
Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you tell?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the name on the door plate,&rdquo; Frank
answered pointing to the silver plate worked in
black letters with the name: &ldquo;Paul Kenfield.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ring the bell harder,&rdquo; suggested Fenn, when
no one had answered in response to Bart&rsquo;s first
attempt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an electric bell, and can ring only so
hard,&rdquo; Bart answered.</p>

<p>They rang several times and waited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The blinds are all closed,&rdquo; spoke Frank, looking
up at the windows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Folks in New York often do that,&rdquo; replied
Bart. &ldquo;If his aunt wasn&rsquo;t home Ned would have
sent us word.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Just then a woman in the next house came to
her door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you looking for Mr. Kenfield?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He sailed for Europe Monday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For Europe?&rdquo; repeated Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Mrs. Kenfield at home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I saw her leave the house yesterday just
before noon. She told me she had a telegram
that some relative was quite ill and she had to
go to Chicago. Her servant girl has gone also.
The house is shut up.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>HUNTING FOR NED</h3>


<p>For a few seconds the boys did not know what
to do. They stood on the steps looking blankly
at one another. The woman observed them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you expecting to call on Mrs. Kenfield?&rdquo;
she asked sympathetically, as she observed
they were strangers in New York.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We came here to visit our chum, Ned Wilding,&rdquo;
said Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That must have been the boy who went off
with Mrs. Kenfield,&rdquo; the woman went on. She
described Ned so the chums had no difficulty in
knowing it was he whom she had seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say he went off with Mrs. Kenfield?&rdquo;
asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, just before noon yesterday. He was
carrying two valises, one had a red mark on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Ned&rsquo;s satchel,&rdquo; said Fenn. &ldquo;That
was some red paint he got on it the day we went
over to Jones&rsquo;s Corners to play ball. One of the
fellows daubed it on for a joke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he didn&rsquo;t come back?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the woman. &ldquo;There has been
no one at home since Mrs. Kenfield went away.
I understand she is going to stay in Chicago for
some time. Her niece is quite ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this is queer,&rdquo; remarked Bart. &ldquo;I wonder
what we had better do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you want to leave a message with me I&rsquo;ll
give it to Mrs. Kenfield when she returns,&rdquo; the
neighbor went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re much obliged to you,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;m afraid that would do little good. Mrs. Kenfield
does not know us. Ned is her nephew and
when she invited him to stay with her she said he
could ask his chums to spend part of the time
with him. Well, we&rsquo;re his chums, but where is
Ned?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he didn&rsquo;t come back here,&rdquo; the woman
continued. &ldquo;I have been watching the house
pretty constantly ever since Mrs. Kenfield went
away, as she asked me to notify any tradesmen,
who might call, that she was gone, but that they
could send their bills to the house by mail and
they would be forwarded to her. I can, however,
give you her Chicago address.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as that would be of any use,
though we&rsquo;re much obliged to you,&rdquo; said Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it would!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart. &ldquo;We can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
wire her and ask where Ned went. She&rsquo;ll probably
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has she got to Chicago yet?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about twenty-four hours since she started,&rdquo;
replied Bart. &ldquo;Even a comparatively slow train
would make it in that time. If you&rsquo;ll give us Mrs.
Kenfield&rsquo;s address,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll wire her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The neighbor gave the boys the desired information
and, since there was nothing more they
could do at the closed house, save stare at the tight
shutters, they started for the nearest telegraph office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I can do anything for you boys, let me
know,&rdquo; the woman said to them as they were leaving.
&ldquo;I am Mrs. Rowland. I have two boys of
my own, and, if you need any further help in
locating your chum, they will be glad to aid you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They thanked Mrs. Rowland, but for whose
information they would have been more in the
dark than they were, regarding Ned&rsquo;s strange disappearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had no idea people were so neighborly in
New York,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;I read somewhere
that in this city no one ever knew who lived next
door to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucky we got some sort of a starting point,&rdquo;
said Bart. &ldquo;Now to send the telegram.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
A few minutes later they found a place where
scores of instruments were clicking away and forwarded
this message, addressed to Mrs. Kenfield:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Ned&rsquo;s chums arrived to find house closed. No
trace of Ned. Understand he went away with
you. Can you tell us where he is now?&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>They told the clerk they would call for the
answer in about two hours, as they wanted to allow
plenty of time for a reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile we&rsquo;ll go and get dinner,&rdquo; suggested
Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s check our valises somewhere,&rdquo; proposed
Bart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired lugging mine around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave &rsquo;em at the station where our trunks
are,&rdquo; Frank put in. &ldquo;We may have to start
back home soon, and they&rsquo;ll be handy for us there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too far away,&rdquo; objected Fenn. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a
good place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pointed to a newsstand built under one of
the elevated railroad stations, where a sign was
displayed, announcing small parcels would be
checked for ten cents. They left their grips, receiving
little brass tags in return, and then went
to a restaurant where they had dinner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lets go back and see if there&rsquo;s an answer to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
our message,&rdquo; suggested Fenn, after they had
walked around a bit. Back they went to the telegraph
office, and found there was a reply. Bart&rsquo;s
hands trembled slightly as he tore open the envelope.
The message from Mrs. Kenfield was a
short one. It read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Ned started for home after leaving me.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Might have known it,&rdquo; remarked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; put in Fenn. &ldquo;What else could
he do? He wouldn&rsquo;t stay in New York, where
he doesn&rsquo;t know a soul, after his aunt and uncle
left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I s&rsquo;pose the only thing for us to do is to
follow Ned back to Darewell,&rdquo; suggested Bart.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s an end to our holiday. Too bad!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why need we go back?&rdquo; asked Frank.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here in New York. It may be many
years before we have another chance like this.
We have enough money to last us a week or more,
even if we have to stay at a hotel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not spend a week in New York anyhow?&rdquo;
Frank went on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad Ned has
gone home. He&rsquo;d stay with us if he was here.
We can go to a cheap hotel and have almost as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
much fun as if we were at Ned&rsquo;s uncle&rsquo;s house.
What&rsquo;s the use going right back home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; came from Bart.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stay a while and see what New York looks
like. Might as well spend some of that money for
hotel bills as anything else. I&rsquo;ve heard they rob
you in New York, but I guess we can look out
for ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s telegraph back to Darewell,&rdquo; suggested
Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To see if Ned got there safely. If he did
maybe he&rsquo;ll come here and join us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; commented Frank. &ldquo;Write out
another message. Send it to Ned&rsquo;s father. He&rsquo;ll
get it quicker at the bank than Ned would at the
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little later this message, signed by Bart, went
clicking over the wires to Darewell.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Is Ned home? His uncle and aunt called
away unexpectedly and he started back for Darewell.
Answer.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The boys said they would call in an hour for a
reply. They spent the time wandering about the
streets. Now, as it was approaching evening, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
thoroughfares were filled with hurrying throngs.
They found the telegram from Darewell waiting
for them when they went back to the office. It
was from Mr. Wilding and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Ned not home. What is the trouble?
Can&rsquo;t you locate him in New York? Try. Will
come on in the morning.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Ned has disappeared,&rdquo; said Bart in strange
tones, as he let the telegram fall to the floor.</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>DOWN THE ROPE</h3>


<p>When Ned started on a run up the street, after
seeing in the station the man he believed was seeking
to arrest him, he had no definite idea where
he was going. All he cared about was to get out
of the inspector&rsquo;s sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go back home,&rdquo; he reasoned as he
hurried on, seeking to lose himself in the crowd.
&ldquo;If I do they&rsquo;ll arrest me as soon as I leave the
train. I can&rsquo;t bring disgrace on my father that
way, though I am innocent of any intentional
wrong-doing. Besides if it was known that I
bought this stock it might injure his reputation at
the bank. They might think he advised me to do
it, and the bank doesn&rsquo;t allow its officials to do
that sort of business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned slowed his pace down from a run to a
rapid walk, as he noticed that several persons were
looking curiously at him. He did not want to
attract attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What had I better do?&rdquo; he asked himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
&ldquo;If I stay here I&rsquo;m liable to arrest any moment.
If I go home I&rsquo;m sure of it as soon as I get off
the train, as every one at the depot knows me.
But they don&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; he added, as a thought came
to him. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one good thing. I&rsquo;m an utter
stranger in New York. The only persons who
know me are my uncle and aunt. They are far
enough off. Of course there&rsquo;s Mary the servant
girl, but I guess she&rsquo;s not liable to meet me. Besides,
she wouldn&rsquo;t know the police wanted me.
Then there&rsquo;s Mr. Skem, but I guess he&rsquo;s too busy
himself, dodging the officers, to be found in this
vicinity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best thing to do,&rdquo; Ned decided.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay in New York until&mdash;well until something
happens. But the worst of it is I can&rsquo;t even
write to the folks at home. I can&rsquo;t let them know
what has occurred. I wonder what the boys will
do when they come and find the house closed? If
I send a letter to father the postal authorities can
trace where it came from and get me. A telegram
would be as bad. I&rsquo;m just like a prisoner
who can&rsquo;t communicate with his friends. The
only thing to do is to stick it out until something
happens. If they would only arrest Skem &amp; Skim
maybe their testimony would clear me. But I
guess they&rsquo;re not likely to catch them. I&rsquo;ve got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
to stick it out alone and it&rsquo;s going to be hard
work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time Ned felt he was far enough away
from the depot to render capture in the immediate
future out of the question. He felt he could risk
walking a little slower, for it was no joke to
hurry along a mile or more carrying his valise,
even though it was not a large one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;m hungry,&rdquo; he said, as he came in
front of a small restaurant. He had taken no
food since breakfast and it was now about four
o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll feel better after
I&rsquo;ve eaten. Besides I&rsquo;ve got to stay somewhere
to-night. I must look for a hotel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did feel more encouraged after he had
dined, and, on inquiring of the cashier in the restaurant,
where he could find a cheap but decent
hotel, was directed to the Imperial a few blocks
distant, back toward the station. Ned thought
this would be safe enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d better take an account of stock,&rdquo; he remarked
to himself as he started for the hotel.
&ldquo;Most of my clothes are in the trunk, and so is
the check dad gave me to have uncle cash. I can&rsquo;t
get at that, and I guess I wouldn&rsquo;t if I could. I&rsquo;d
have to endorse it to cash it, and when I wrote my
name whoever saw it might tell the police.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Ned&rsquo;s imagination probably made things seem
worse than they really were, but he was unaccustomed
to city ways, and the memory of the inspector&rsquo;s
words, and the angry men who had lost
money through Skem &amp; Skim acted as an incentive
for him to do everything possible to avoid arrest,
which he felt would follow any disclosure of his
identity, such as would result from endorsing a
check.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only clothes I&rsquo;ve got are on me,&rdquo; Ned
went on, continuing the process of &ldquo;stock taking.&rdquo;
He had a change of underwear and some clean
collars, cuffs and handkerchiefs in his valise, and
about ten dollars in bills. In his pocketbook he
carried five dollars and there was a little change
in his overcoat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to sail pretty close to the wind,&rdquo; he
told himself. &ldquo;Fifteen dollars isn&rsquo;t going very
far in New York. I must get work to do until
this thing blows over, or something happens.
That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do. I&rsquo;ll look for a job to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hotel at which Ned arrived a few minutes
later did not look very inviting. Still, he reflected,
he was not in a position to be particular.
It was a five-storied building, and on both sides
of it, were shops for the sale of various articles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
&ldquo;Can you give me a cheap room?&rdquo; asked Ned
of the clerk behind the desk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sell you one, you mean I guess,&rdquo; was the man&rsquo;s
reply as he went on with the operation of cleaning
his finger nails. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t give &rsquo;em away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to engage a room for the night,&rdquo; Ned
went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dollar&rsquo;s the cheapest we&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Register,&rdquo; the clerk said, swinging the book
around in front of Ned, and handing him a pen
which he dipped into the dirty ink bottle. Then
he went on with his manicuring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must sign my name,&rdquo; thought Ned. &ldquo;No
I can&rsquo;t do that! They might trace me!&rdquo; He
felt the rustle of the stock certificate in his pocket
as he took the pen. What was he to do?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it necessary to register?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Course it is,&rdquo; replied the clerk looking at him
curiously. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the law. Everybody who
stops at a hotel has to put their name on the book.
What&rsquo;s the matter? You ain&rsquo;t afraid to register,
are you? Don&rsquo;t look as though you&rsquo;d committed
a murder or had robbed some one,&rdquo; and the clerk
grinned at his joke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; Ned replied, his heart
thumping away under his overcoat. Then he resolved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
to put on the book a fictitious name. He
hesitated a moment and inscribed: &ldquo;Thomas
Seldon,&rdquo; in a large hand as unlike as possible
from his own usual small writing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thomas Seldon, eh?&rdquo; queried the clerk as he
turned the book around once more. &ldquo;Where you
from? That has to go down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once more Ned hesitated. What should he
answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Forget where you live?&rdquo;
the clerk asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s Perryville, New York,&rdquo; replied
Ned, taking a name at random, as he had the one
he signed in the book.</p>

<p>The clerk told him to write it down, and after
this was done the number 113 was placed after
his name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hope you&rsquo;re not superstitious,&rdquo; the clerk remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a thirteen in your room number.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some folks do,&rdquo; the clerk continued. &ldquo;But
that&rsquo;s the only dollar room we&rsquo;ve got left.
Front!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A boy answered the ring of the bell which the
clerk touched, and, taking Ned&rsquo;s grip led the way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
A rattling, shaking elevator, of an antiquated type,
carried Ned and his guide to the fifth floor. The
young porter opened the door of a small room
and set Ned&rsquo;s grip down inside of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where you bunk,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

<p>Ned had read of the necessity for tips in New
York, and handed the boy a dime. The lad
seemed to welcome it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;T&rsquo;anks,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that rope for?&rdquo; asked Ned, as he
noticed one in a corner of his room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire escape. New law. All rooms has to
have &rsquo;em,&rdquo; the boy replied. &ldquo;If the shebang goes
up you drop the rope out of the window and slide
down. Your window&rsquo;s right over the back yard
and there&rsquo;s a gate that leads out into a side street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do they have many fires?&rdquo; asked Ned, feeling
a bit nervous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many? Every day ten or a dozen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean around here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t had none since I worked here, but when
this place goes it&rsquo;ll go quick. It&rsquo;s about a thousand
years old, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the boy had gone Ned looked out of
the window. It overlooked the rear yard of the
hotel, a place filled with boxes, barrels and all
sorts of rubbish. The rope was fastened to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
iron ring in the wall, and looked stout enough to
hold several men. It was long enough to reach
to the ground, as Ned could see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hope I don&rsquo;t have to use it,&rdquo; he thought.</p>

<p>Leaving his valise in his room, Ned went downstairs,
again, the old elevator taking considerable
time on the trip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look around a bit, have some supper and
then go to bed,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;Maybe my luck
will change to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned after walking about the streets for awhile
went back to the same restaurant where he had
dined before, as he did not fancy the looks of his
hotel well enough to eat there. He strolled about
through the brilliantly lighted streets after supper
pondering on his curious plight, and then went
back to the Imperial.</p>

<p>As he approached the desk to get to the elevator
he saw a stout man in close conversation with the
clerk. He could hear the latter, in reply to some
question, say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess we haven&rsquo;t got anybody here you want,
Jim. No new ones came except a kid. Queer
thing about him, though, I believe he&rsquo;s registered
under the wrong name. Acts sort of funny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What name did he give?&rdquo; asked the stout
man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Never&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;ever&rsquo;&mdash;no, that isn&rsquo;t it but it&rsquo;s
something like that. &lsquo;Seldom&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s it&mdash;no
it isn&rsquo;t either&mdash;&lsquo;Seldon,&rsquo; that&rsquo;s it. &lsquo;Thomas Seldon.&rsquo;
I sized him up for a queer one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to get a look at him,&rdquo; the stout man
went on. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as we have any call for
him, but it&rsquo;s best to be on the safe side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned felt his knees beginning to shake. He
wondered who the big man might be. Just then
the youthful porter sauntered toward him. Ned
had come to a halt half way up the lobby of the
hotel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pipe off that guy?&rdquo; asked the boy in a friendly
whisper, with a nod at the stout man. Ned understood
the question to mean &ldquo;Do you know who
that man is?&rdquo; and he answered that he did not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the detectives from the Central Office.
The sleuths come here same as at other
hotels, every once in a while, to see if anybody
they want might happen to be on hand. Guess he
won&rsquo;t land anybody this time, though, about a
week ago&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Ned did not stop to listen. The stairway
was in front of him, and he could get to his room
without the clerk or the detective seeing him.</p>

<p>As he started up the stairs, intending to go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
his apartment and hide, for he had left the key
in the lock, the boy-porter called after him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take the cage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The elevator&rsquo;s too slow,&rdquo; Ned answered, trying
to keep his voice from trembling. He was
afraid the men might hear him. But they did not,
and, walking swiftly he was soon in his room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; poor Ned asked himself.
He seemed hounded on every side. &ldquo;I must get
away from here,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;The clerk suspects
me! Perhaps that detective has a description
of me! I must sneak out, and yet&mdash;I can&rsquo;t
go. I haven&rsquo;t paid for my room!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he caught sight of the rope fire escape.
An idea came to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll slide down the rope to the ground,&rdquo; he
murmured. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way. I can get off
without any one seeing me, and I&rsquo;ll go to another
hotel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He loosened the rope, which was looped upon
a hook, and looked down into the yard. All was
dark and quiet there. He tied his valise to the
end of the rope and lowered it. The little thud
of the satchel as it landed and slipped from the
noose of the rope told him it was in the yard.
Then, having left a dollar bill pinned to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of the pillows of the bed, Ned put on his hat
and overcoat, and, taking a firm hold of the rope
stepped out of the window and went down, hand
over hand. It was a trick he had often performed,
though it was hard to descend the five
stories. At last his feet touched the ground, and
he breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now to take my valise and skip,&rdquo; he said in
a whisper. &ldquo;That was pretty well done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stooped over to loosen his satchel from the
rope. His fingers encountered nothing but the
hempen strands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My valise is gone!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>IN THE LODGING HOUSE</h3>


<p>Ned felt around on the ground. He thought
the valise might have slipped from the rope and
rolled away into some corner of the yard. He
got down on his knees and crawled about, looking
among boxes and barrels, as well as he could in
the darkness. But the valise was gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where in the world could it have disappeared
to?&rdquo; Ned asked himself. &ldquo;I came down within
three minutes after I lowered it to the ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a gate, opening from the yard to the
street, and Ned decided some one had either seen
or heard the valise drop and had slipped in and
stolen it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I am in a pickle,&rdquo; the lad murmured.
&ldquo;No baggage, not even a clean collar, only a little
over four dollars left&rdquo; (for he had taken one
from his pocketbook to leave for his room rent),
&ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t even tell the police I&rsquo;ve been robbed.
If I do they&rsquo;ll question me and find out I&rsquo;m wanted
for that stock matter. I certainly am up against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
it. But I guess I&rsquo;d better get away from here.
That detective may go to my room, discover that
I&rsquo;ve gone, and make a search.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned peered out of the gate. The street was
deserted at that moment. With a hasty look up
at the window of his room he had just left, and
from which the rope still dangled, Ned, in worse
plight than he had been before, hurried away.
Once more he felt himself an outcast, without a
place to go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When they see that rope they&rsquo;ll suspect I&rsquo;m
some sort of a criminal,&rdquo; he reflected bitterly.
&ldquo;What a lot of trouble a fellow can get into without
meaning it,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;This is the last
time I&rsquo;ll ever buy stocks or bonds on my own
responsibility. I guess dad can manage finances
until I learn the ropes a little better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He walked on, not knowing whither he was
bound. He emerged from the side street to one
of the main thoroughfares. There he mingled
with the crowds, believing, that for the present
at least, he was safe from pursuit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve got to stay somewhere to-night,&rdquo; he
told himself. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t walk the streets forever. I
wonder if there isn&rsquo;t some place where I can get a
bed without having to answer a lot of questions
about myself?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
As he walked along an illuminated sign, on a
building across the street, attracted his attention.
It informed those who cared to know that the
place was the &ldquo;Owl Lodging House,&rdquo; and that
single beds could be had for fifteen cents a night,
or a room including the privilege of a bath, for
twenty-five cents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That about fits my pocketbook,&rdquo; Ned reasoned.
&ldquo;Twenty-five cents a night is cheaper than
a dollar, and I&rsquo;ve got to be saving. I wonder if
it&rsquo;s clean? It seems like living in a tenement
house, but I s&rsquo;pose lots of men have to. I&rsquo;ll try
it anyhow. If I don&rsquo;t like the looks of it I can
leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He walked up the stairs. Certainly the place
would not have taken a prize for cleanliness but
then, Ned reflected, beggars must not be choosers.
He emerged into a big room, lighted by several
gas jets, and seemingly filled with men in chairs
who were lolling about in all sorts of attitudes.
Some were asleep and some were reading newspapers.
As Ned stood irresolutely gazing on the
scene his thoughts were interrupted by a sharp
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, young man, do you want a room or a
bed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any rooms left?&rdquo; asked Ned, turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
to see a man staring at him from a small window
in an office built against one side of the apartment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lots of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; replied the clerk of the lodging
house. &ldquo;Twenty-five cents. Pay in advance.
This isn&rsquo;t the Waldorf-Astoria.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned handed a quarter through the half circular
opening and received in return a key with a big
brass tag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I register?&rdquo; asked Ned, hoping that
he would not have to put down another false
name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Register nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; the clerk replied. &ldquo;They
go by numbers here. Yours is seventeen,&rdquo; and
Ned, looking at the tag on his key, saw what the
clerk meant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad there&rsquo;s no thirteen in this,&rdquo; the boy
thought. &ldquo;How do I get to my room?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right along the corridor. You can&rsquo;t miss it.
Go on until you strike the right number and go in.
Do you snore?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because there is a man in the next room to
you who says he&rsquo;ll punch my face in, if I put any
one near him who snores. It&rsquo;s all right. Go
ahead. If you want a bath it&rsquo;s the last room at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the end of the hall, but you have to furnish your
own soap and towels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That settles the bath question,&rdquo; thought Ned;
&ldquo;that is unless I dry myself on a pocket handkerchief,
and I guess I&rsquo;d better save that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lock your door,&rdquo; the clerk called after him.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not responsible for anything stolen from
the rooms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned had not expected much for twenty-five
cents, and the small room, the little narrow iron
cot, and the scanty supply of coverings did not disappoint
him. The room was merely separated
from the others, in the row of which it was, by
partitions that did not extend all the way to the
ceiling. Ned sat down on the chair and gazed
about him. He could hear men in the next rooms
breathing heavily. It was rather chilly for there
was no fire in the bedrooms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can use my overcoat for a blanket,&rdquo; Ned
inadvertently spoke aloud. The next moment a
voice, from the room on his left startled him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, in seventeen!&rdquo; called a man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you snore?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. If you do there&rsquo;ll be trouble. I&rsquo;m
a light sleeper.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Ned wondered who his unseen questioner was,
but he was too tired to care much.</p>

<p>He undressed, and crawled into bed. His
overcoat answered well for a blanket, and soon
he began to feel warm and drowsy, in spite of his
strange surroundings.</p>

<p>He must have slept for several hours when he
was suddenly awakened by a pounding on his
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it? Is the place afire?&rdquo; he called,
sitting up in bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire nothing! I want my money you took!&rdquo;
It was the voice of the man who had asked him
if he snored.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t your money,&rdquo; Ned answered, thinking
the man might be a lunatic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have! You sneaked into my room
and took it! I woke up just in time! Open the
door or I&rsquo;ll break it down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned sprang from his bed and turned the key.
The door flew open and a big man with a red
moustache entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me my money!&rdquo; he demanded, striding
up to Ned.</p>

<h3>NED FLEES AGAIN</h3>


<p>&ldquo;I tell you I haven&rsquo;t your money!&rdquo; exclaimed
Ned. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know what I mean well enough! I had
a lot of dollar bills under my pillow! You
sneaked in and took them! I want my money!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I tell you I haven&rsquo;t it and didn&rsquo;t take
it!&rdquo; Ned repeated. &ldquo;This is my room, and
you&rsquo;d better get out of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not until I have my money! Where is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He lifted a pillow from Ned&rsquo;s bed. Under it
were four one dollar bills which Ned had placed
there before he went to sleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s part of it, anyhow!&rdquo; the man exclaimed.
&ldquo;I want the rest now! Fork it over!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my money!&rdquo; cried Ned, as the red-moustached
man took the bills and stuffed them
into his pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your money! A likely story! Anybody
with as much money as that would never stop in a
place like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
&ldquo;How did you happen to stop here then?&rdquo;
asked Ned quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me? Why young impudence, I&rsquo;m the proprietor
of this lodging house! I live here! That&rsquo;s
why. Hey, Bill!&rdquo; he called in a loud voice,
&ldquo;come here. There&rsquo;s trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In answer to the summons a big man, evidently
the night porter or watchman, came shuffling down
the corridor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble, boss?&rdquo; he asked, and
Ned began to believe the man had spoken the
truth when he said he was the proprietor of the
place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, here&rsquo;s a kid comes into my room when
I&rsquo;m asleep and takes my cash right from under my
pillow. I wake up just in time to see him sneak
back into his room and when I get him with the
goods on him he has the impudence to deny it.
There&rsquo;s part of the cash,&rdquo; and he showed Ned&rsquo;s
money, &ldquo;but I want the rest. Better call a policeman,
Bill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, boss. Just as you say,&rdquo; and the
porter shuffled off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say you&rsquo;re going to have me
arrested on a charge of stealing your money?&rdquo;
asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I am unless you give it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t take it. It must have been some
one else, if you really were robbed. Why don&rsquo;t
you look in some of the other rooms along here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I saw you come in here after you
were in my room, and had your hand under my
pillow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you be mistaken?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much. I&rsquo;ve been in this business too long.
&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t the first time I&rsquo;ve been robbed, but it&rsquo;s the
first time I got the thief and I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to make an
example of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re making a big mistake,&rdquo; Ned said, trying
to speak bravely, but the accusation, unjust as
it was, coupled with his other misfortunes was
almost too much for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the chances on that. Who are you,
anyhow? What&rsquo;s your name, and where&rsquo;d you
come from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned hesitated. If he gave his real name it might
lead to trouble over the stock, in case the proprietor
carried out the threat to have him arrested.
He was not used to telling untruths and he was
afraid if he gave a false name he would soon betray
himself. Still it seemed the best thing to do
and would harm no one save himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s George Anderson,&rdquo; he said boldly.
&ldquo;Where I came from is none of your affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
&ldquo;Afraid to tell, eh? Well, the judge will soon
have it out of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was quite cold now, and Ned, standing half
dressed as he was in the room, began to shiver.
He put on his clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;s a wise thing to do,&rdquo; the proprietor
of the lodging house remarked. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
get a ride in the hurry-up wagon soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words struck a chill of terror to Ned&rsquo;s
heart. Must he spend the rest of the night in a
cell? The man&rsquo;s manner showed no relenting.
He either believed Ned had robbed him or was
insisting on the charge for some reason of his
own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you in earnest about this?&rdquo; asked Ned,
as he put on his hat and overcoat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can make up your mind to that,&rdquo; was the
man&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be the jail for yours, in a
little while, if you don&rsquo;t give me back my money.
It isn&rsquo;t too late. I can fix it with the cop if you&rsquo;ll
give up. Why look here, kid, they&rsquo;ll search you
and find it on you. You haven&rsquo;t had time to hide
it, and, besides, there&rsquo;s no place in this room. You
must have it on you. Give it up and save trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t your money,&rdquo; Ned said boldly.
&ldquo;Those bills you took from under the pillow were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
mine. You can search me now if you want to.
That is all the money I have except a little change
in my overcoat pocket,&rdquo; and he showed the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That don&rsquo;t go with me. I&rsquo;m sure you robbed
me. I&rsquo;ll not search you or you&rsquo;d say I was up to
some game, and nobody ever said but what Jim
Cassidy was honest, though he does keep a cheap
lodging house. No, sir, the cop&rsquo;ll search you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned knew the officer would find nothing&mdash;except
the stock certificate. There was the trouble.
Ned thought every officer in New York had a
description of it and was looking for the boy who
carried it. No, he couldn&rsquo;t allow himself to be
searched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s cold!&rdquo; exclaimed Cassidy suddenly, as he
shivered in his long nightrobe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to get
dressed. Better not try to run or I&rsquo;ll nab you.
I&rsquo;ll be in the next room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went into his own apartment and Ned could
hear him putting on his clothes. By the grunts
and puffs that ensued he judged Cassidy was having
hard work, as he was a large man, and putting
on a shirt was no easy matter.</p>

<p>Then a daring plan came into Ned&rsquo;s mind. In
spite of the excitement caused by the proprietor&rsquo;s
entrance into his room and the loud talking that
followed the accusation, none of the other lodgers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
had gotten up. Even sending the porter for a
policeman had not excited any curiosity.</p>

<p>Ned resolved to make his escape if possible.
He thought he could slip past Cassidy&rsquo;s door and
down the stairs before Bill would return with a
policeman. He got upon the bed and looked over
the partition into Cassidy&rsquo;s room. The proprietor
was putting on his shoes and had his back to
the door. There was a light at the far end of the
corridor, illuminating it dimly.</p>

<p>Ned took off his own shoes, and, carrying them
in his hand stepped to the door of his room. He
stole softly into the corridor and was about to
slip past Cassidy&rsquo;s room when the door of the
apartment opposite his opened just a crack and a
hoarse voice whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, cully! If youse wants t&rsquo; make a git-away,
go de other way an&rsquo; down de back stairs.
Youse kin slip around through de alley an&rsquo; inter
de street &rsquo;fore de cop comes. I heard what youse
said and ye sounds honest, an&rsquo; dat&rsquo;s more&rsquo;n ye kin
say fer a lot in dis joint. Quick, some one&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;
up de front stairs!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, before Ned could thank his unknown
friend, the door was shut. Ned could hear Cassidy
getting up from the chair on which he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
seated himself to lace his shoes. There was not
a moment to spare.</p>

<p>Making no sound in his stocking feet, Ned hurried
down the dark corridor, away from the front
of the building. He had to trust almost entirely
to feeling, as the gleam from the single lamp
farther toward the front stairs did not penetrate
thus far. He did not even know where the rear
flight was, but trusted to luck to find them. With
his hand stretched out in front of him, to avoid
running into any obstructions he went on as fast
as he could. Suddenly he turned a corner in the
passage and saw a dim light. Then he observed
a flight of stairs leading downward. He listened
a moment. Behind him he could hear the tramp
of heavy feet, and guessed that Bill had returned
with the policeman.</p>

<p>Ned hurried down the stairs. He stopped only
long enough, when he reached the bottom, to put
his shoes on, but did not lace them. He only
tucked the ends of the strings into the tops so
they would not dangle and trip him if he had to
run. Then Ned stepped from the hallway into
the dark and deserted street. Once more, though
entirely innocent, he had been obliged to flee from
officers of the law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting to be a habit with me,&rdquo; he said
grimly, as he hurried along.</p>

<p>What happened back in the lodging house he
did not know and he cared less. That his flight
would seem a confession of guilt he was sure; but
what did it matter?</p>

<p>It was cold and dark and cheerless in the streets.
He was a night wanderer, with no place to go,
and, as far as he knew, not a friend in the big
city.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll have to walk the streets all night,&rdquo;
poor Ned thought. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t much money left.&rdquo;
He felt in the pocket of his overcoat, and counted
the change. There was less than a dollar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have to take fifteen cent beds after this,&rdquo; he
remarked to himself. &ldquo;As for eating I guess I&rsquo;ll
have to cut that out altogether.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He walked through several thoroughfares. Not
a soul did he meet save once as he passed a policeman
the officer stared at him suspiciously. But
Ned still had his good clothes with him, and his
overcoat though crumpled from being used as a
bed-spread, made him look decent enough to pass
muster in the neighborhood where he was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll find another lodging house and
get a bed,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;I must get a
little rest if I am to look for work to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
He had no difficulty in finding a place, for there
were many such nearby. He got a fifteen cent
bed, in a room where scores of other men and
youths were sleeping. His entrance excited no
comment, and, in fact, few were awake to notice
his arrival.</p>

<p>Ned was so tired he fell asleep with most of
his clothes on. He had little fear of being robbed
for he had little left to take. He got a frugal
breakfast the next morning and started out to
search for work.</p>

<p>But New York seemed to be overflowing with
men and boys on the same errand. Every place
where Ned applied, either from seeing a sign
&ldquo;Boy Wanted,&rdquo; or by getting the address from a
newspaper he bought, had been taken or else he
would not fill the bill. All day long he tramped,
spending a few cents for some buns and coffee at
a lunch stand. At night, tired and discouraged,
he went back to the lodging house where he had
last stayed, and again got a fifteen cent bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow&rsquo;s Thursday,&rdquo; thought Ned, as he
crawled under his overcoat, which he once more
used as a blanket. &ldquo;I wonder if the boys arrived
to-day? What could they have thought
when they saw the house closed? Oh, I wish I
could find them. If this keeps on I&rsquo;ll have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
pawn my overcoat for something to eat, and it
looks as if it would snow to-morrow. What a
pickle I&rsquo;m in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, in spite of his troubles he fell asleep, for
he was very tired.</p>

<h3>OUT IN THE STORM</h3>


<p>The telegram from Ned&rsquo;s father, which the
three chums received that Wednesday evening,
telling them their friend was not at his home in
Darewell, was a great shock to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; remarked Bart, as he picked up the
message he had dropped, &ldquo;it hardly seems possible.
I wonder where in the world he can be. He
starts for home but he never arrives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we sure he started for home?&rdquo; asked
Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why of course,&rdquo; Fenn answered. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
the telegram from Mrs. Kenfield say so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She would hardly know,&rdquo; Frank went on.
&ldquo;Ned&rsquo;s train for Darewell wouldn&rsquo;t leave until
four o&rsquo;clock. The timetable shows that. According
to what the woman who lives next door to
Mrs. Kenfield told us, Ned&rsquo;s aunt started away
before noon. Her train must have left about that
time, so Ned couldn&rsquo;t have gotten away from New
York, if he left at all, until after his aunt had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
started for Chicago. Consequently though she
may have seen him leave the depot where she was,
with the intention of going back to Darewell, that&rsquo;s
no proof that he really went back home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; admitted Bart, struck with the
force of Frank&rsquo;s reasoning. &ldquo;But where then
can he be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve got to find out,&rdquo; said Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are we going to do it?&rdquo; Bart inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Ned&rsquo;s right here in New York,&rdquo; Frank
went on. &ldquo;Now look at it. His aunt goes away
unexpectedly and closes the house up. It would
seem natural for Ned to go back home, but we
find out he has not. He doesn&rsquo;t know any one
else in this part of the country, or he would have
told us. Consequently he has not gone to any
other city. Therefore he must be in New York.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why would he stay here?&rdquo; insisted Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably for the same reason we&rsquo;re going to,
in order to see the sights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t he send some word home to
let his father know?&rdquo; Bart asked. &ldquo;Mr. Wilding
wouldn&rsquo;t be starting for New York if he knew
Ned was safe here. Ned hasn&rsquo;t communicated
with his father, that&rsquo;s sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I forgot about that,&rdquo; Frank admitted. &ldquo;That
makes it look different.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
&ldquo;Maybe something has happened to him,&rdquo; suggested
Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look for trouble, Stumpy,&rdquo; remarked
Bart. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad enough as it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;However I still think Ned is in New York,&rdquo;
Frank went on. &ldquo;He may be sick or he may
have been hurt, which would prevent him communicating
with us, or with his father. But that he&rsquo;s
in this city I&rsquo;m sure. Now the thing for us to do
is to find him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are dozens of ways. We must communicate
with the police and ask their help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ned wouldn&rsquo;t like that,&rdquo; interposed Bart.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a criminal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Frank answered. &ldquo;But the
police have to help find lots of persons who are
not criminals. If Ned&rsquo;s in trouble we want to
know it as soon as possible so we can help him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the sooner we start the better,&rdquo; suggested
Bart. &ldquo;Where ought we to begin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s ask the agent here at the station where
Ned&rsquo;s train came in,&rdquo; Frank said. &ldquo;Perhaps he
may have noticed him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not likely,&rdquo; replied Bart. &ldquo;Too many passengers
coming and going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They made some inquiries, but, as Bart had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
said, there were too many arrivals and departures
for the agent to have taken particular note of a
boy among a thousand others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That settles one end of it,&rdquo; remarked Fenn,
as they were about to leave the depot. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
arrange to stop at some hotel. We&rsquo;re going to
be here several days, very likely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we are,&rdquo; Frank replied. &ldquo;Hold on!
Wait a minute! I&rsquo;ve just thought of something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The baggage room. We can find out if there
are any trunks from Darewell, besides our own,
that have not been called for. Besides I know
Ned&rsquo;s when I see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They hurried to the baggage agent and told
him what they wanted. He soon ascertained from
his records that four trunks had come in from
Darewell in the last few days. Three were those
of the three chums, which had arrived that
noon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got one other,&rdquo; the agent said. &ldquo;It came
in Monday, and there are storage charges on it
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can we look at it?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>The agent showed it to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Ned&rsquo;s trunk!&rdquo; cried Frank. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
on the track. He hasn&rsquo;t left New York, that&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
sure. Has any one called for that trunk?&rdquo; he
asked the agent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but I wish they would. It&rsquo;s in the way
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you let us know in case any one does
call?&rdquo; Frank went on, giving his reasons for the
request. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pay you for your trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose I could. Where&rsquo;ll you be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We ought to stop at some hotel near here,&rdquo;
Frank suggested. &ldquo;Then we can come here
quickly if we get a message.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know of a good hotel near here?&rdquo;
asked Bart of the agent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the Imperial a few blocks up the
street. It&rsquo;s not especially good, but it&rsquo;s respectable.
I guess you could stop there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; Frank said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get
rooms there. We will send for our trunks, and
you can telephone us in case that other one is
called for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave the man a couple of dollars to pay for
his trouble, and for any telephone messages he
might have to send, and then the three chums
went to the same hotel where Ned had stopped.</p>

<p>The same clerk was on duty who had been there
when Ned registered, and he seemed rather surprised
at the three well dressed youths who entered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Usually the Imperial, in spite of its name,
did not attract such a class of patrons. The boys
bargained for three connecting rooms, and, as they
had plenty of money were given good apartments
on the second floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Register,&rdquo; the clerk said, swinging the book
around to them.</p>

<p>As Bart took the pen to write his name, he
looked at the book and gave a start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought first that was Ned&rsquo;s writing,&rdquo; he
said as he looked where his chum, but a few hours
before had written &ldquo;Thomas Seldon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friend of yours?&rdquo; asked the clerk quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought first it looked like the writing of a
chum of mine,&rdquo; Bart replied. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s different
I see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess that chap doesn&rsquo;t travel in your company,&rdquo;
the clerk went on, as the other boys put
down their names.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s a crook I guess,&rdquo; and he told of the
discovery of Ned&rsquo;s escape down the rope. &ldquo;He
hasn&rsquo;t done anything as far as we can learn,&rdquo; the
clerk went on, &ldquo;but his getting out that way
showed there was something wrong, though he
was honest enough to leave a dollar for his room,
which he didn&rsquo;t occupy. However, the police<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
would like to get him just to see why he was in
such a hurry to get away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Funny thing, too,&rdquo; the clerk continued. &ldquo;He
left his valise behind him. He must have lowered
it out of the window by the rope, or else he
threw it out. Anyway, just before we found out
that he had gone, our chef went out in the back
yard for a breath of air. He saw the valise lying
on the ground, but didn&rsquo;t take notice of the rope.
He brought the satchel in and gave it to me. I
was talking to a detective at the desk, one who
comes in here every once in a while to see if there
are any suspicious characters. I was telling him
about this Seldon lad, just as the cook handed me
the grip. I recognized it as the one the boy had
when he came in, and got suspicious. We went
to his room, but he had skipped. We&rsquo;ve got the
valise yet, but haven&rsquo;t opened it. The police may
in a few days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys slept soundly that night. They awoke
in the morning to find a heavy snow storm in
progress. They spent the day going from one
place to another, following the advice they got at
the office of the chief of police. But all to no
purpose. There was no trace of Ned. They
were out almost all day in the storm, which continued
to get worse as night approached.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing we forgot,&rdquo; said Frank, as
they prepared to go back to the hotel for the
night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should have let Mr. Wilding know where
we are stopping. You know he said he was coming
to New York. We must send him a wire.
If he has left Darewell, the bank will know his
address here, and forward it to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This plan, Frank&rsquo;s chums decided, was a wise
one. They turned toward a telegraph office which
they had noticed near their hotel. As they were
going down a dark side street Bart, who was in
advance, stumbled over something and fell into a
snow drift.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurt yourself?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. It was like falling into a feather bed,
only it&rsquo;s cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then something like a groan sounded from
the object Bart had stumbled over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p>The three boys bent over the object.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a boy!&rdquo; cried Frank. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s almost
frozen to death. Come on, fellows! We must
carry him to some shelter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better take him to our hotel,&rdquo; suggested Bart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
They picked up the boy, who was lying in a
drift of snow on the sidewalk, and hurried on with
him. Feeble moans came from between the unknown&rsquo;s
white lips.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>NED&rsquo;S PREDICAMENT</h3>


<p>When Ned awakened Thursday morning in
the lodging house and, on looking from the window
saw that it was snowing, his unpleasant position
came forcibly to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is nice,&rdquo; he reflected as he put on his
shoes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as cold as Greenland out of doors,
and I&rsquo;m down to&mdash;let&rsquo;s see what my cash capital
is, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He fumbled in the change pocket of his overcoat,
and found a few coins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thirty cents,&rdquo; he murmured as he looked at
them. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough for three five-cent meals,
and enough to pay for a bed to-night. I&rsquo;ll need
the bed too, if this storm keeps up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He finished dressing and went to the window to
look out. It was anything but a pleasant day on
which to look for work. The wind had blown
the snow into big drifts, and the white flakes were
still falling. It was cold too, as he could tell by
the draught that came in around the window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
&ldquo;Come now, everybody clear out!&rdquo; called a
voice, and one of the porters of the lodging house
appeared with a pail and broom. &ldquo;Got to clean up
the place. Fifteen cents doesn&rsquo;t mean you fellers
can make a hotel of this place and hang around
all day. Clear out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we stay until it stops snowin&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked
one of the men, who were crowded around the
big stove in the sleeping room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You kin if you pay for another night&rsquo;s lodging,&rdquo;
was the answer. &ldquo;What do you think this
is, the Salvation Army or the Y. M. C. A.? If
you want free graft go there. You has to pay for
what you gits here. Clear out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no help for it. Those who hoped
to remain in away from the storm, where it was at
least warm, though not very inviting, were doomed
to disappointment. A few, who had the money,
paid for another night&rsquo;s lodging, which gave them
the privilege of remaining in during the day.</p>

<p>Ned had half a notion to do this, but he reflected
he might find a place to work which would
be so far from the lodging house that he could not
conveniently return. So he decided to save his
money until he could find out what the day might
hold for him.</p>

<p>With scores of other unfortunates he left the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
warm room and went out into the cold. He was
glad he was well clothed and that he still had his
overcoat. How long he could keep it, before he
would have to pawn it for food, he did not know.
He almost decided to go back to the hotel where
he had first stayed and see if they knew anything
about his valise. That had ten dollars in it.
Then the thought of the detective deterred him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I had the four dollars the lodging house
proprietor stole from me I&rsquo;d think I was rich,&rdquo; he
murmured. &ldquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t dare go back after
it. He&rsquo;d have me arrested sure! Though I
may have to submit to that to get a warm place to
sleep and something to eat, if I don&rsquo;t get work
soon,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>It was very cold. As soon as Ned got out into
the street, where he could feel the full sweep of
the wind he shivered though his overcoat was a
thick one. The snow was blown into his face with
stinging force.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As long as it doesn&rsquo;t make any difference which
way I go I may as well have the wind at my back,&rdquo;
he reasoned as he turned and walked in the opposite
direction. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s more comfortable, at any
rate,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Now I must get something
to eat, if it&rsquo;s only a cup of coffee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He walked on until he saw a restaurant. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the window was a big gas stove on which a man,
in a white uniform and cap, was browning some
buckwheat cakes. They looked so good they made
Ned&rsquo;s mouth fairly water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have some,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;It
will take fifteen cents, if I get coffee with them,
but it&rsquo;s worth it. I&rsquo;ll make this meal do for dinner
too. But supper&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned did not dare carry his thoughts further.
All he knew was that he was very hungry, and at
least he had money enough to pay for a simple
meal. Supper must take care of itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I can get a night&rsquo;s lodging at some
free place, and save the rest of my money for
supper and breakfast to-morrow,&rdquo; Ned thought to
himself as he entered the restaurant.</p>

<p>He ordered a plate of the cakes and some coffee,
and could hardly wait until the girl had placed
them on the table in front of him. He got a
small pitcher of what passed for maple syrup, and
there was a plate of butter from which all at the
table helped themselves.</p>

<p>Ned finished the cakes in short order. The coffee
was hot if nothing else, but Ned was surprised
at the small place in his big appetite which the
cakes filled. He almost felt like ordering more
but decided it would be rash to reduce his capital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
to five cents. As it was now, when he had paid
for his breakfast, he would have fifteen cents left
out of the thirty.</p>

<p>With the pasteboard check which the girl had
left at his plate, in his hand, Ned approached the
cashier&rsquo;s desk in the front part of the restaurant.
His fingers went into the change pocket of his
overcoat, searching for the money. He could feel
nothing but the lining. A blank look came over
his face. He was sure he had put the money back
into that pocket as he finished counting it when he
sat on the edge of his bed. Yet it was not there.
Hurriedly he felt in all his other pockets.</p>

<p>Meanwhile several customers behind him were
impatiently waiting to pay their checks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One side,&rdquo; said the cashier in a gruff tone, as
he saw Ned fumbling through his pockets.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you? Left your memory
home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve lost my money,&rdquo; Ned answered,
his voice trembling a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve got another think coming,&rdquo; the
clerk said in an ugly tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that story
before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What story?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About forgetting your money. Left it in the
bank I s&rsquo;pose, or home on the pianer, or you&rsquo;ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
got to have a check cashed. What is it, speak
quick, I&rsquo;ve got no time to fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While he was talking, the man was busy making
change for other customers who walked past Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that you think I&rsquo;m trying to
cheat you?&rdquo; asked the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean anything if you pay for what
you&rsquo;ve eaten. If you don&rsquo;t pay&mdash;well&mdash;there&rsquo;s
a cop just around the corner, and we&rsquo;ve had your
same kind in here before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time Ned stood alone in front of the
desk, as the line of waiting men had passed out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had my money when I came in here,&rdquo; said
the boy. &ldquo;Or at least I think I did. I had it a
little while before, I&rsquo;m sure, for I counted it.
There was thirty cents&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you look like now,&rdquo; the cashier
interrupted, with a coarse laugh at his joke.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be thirty days for yours if you don&rsquo;t settle
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t got the money,&rdquo; replied poor
Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you shouldn&rsquo;t have eaten anything. Do
you think we&rsquo;re feedin&rsquo; beggars here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I had the money when I ordered
the cakes,&rdquo; Ned replied, staring helplessly at the
fifteen cent check in his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
&ldquo;Say, young feller, that&rsquo;s too thin. It don&rsquo;t
go here any more. I&rsquo;ve been stung too often with
that yarn. You&rsquo;ll pay for your grub or you&rsquo;ll be
arrested, see? Have you got the money; yes or
no?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t&mdash;but if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if we let you go you&rsquo;ll stop in on your
way from the bank and give us a check! No you
don&rsquo;t! A fellow gave me that song and dance last
week. Jim, call the cop,&rdquo; and the cashier nodded
to one of the men waiters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to have me arrested?&rdquo; exclaimed
Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I am. It&rsquo;s a criminal offense to
order a meal, eat it, and not pay for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned did not know what to do.</p>

<h3>A QUEER IDENTIFICATION</h3>


<p>Stumbling through the snow drifts the three
chums bore the half-unconscious boy they had
picked up in the snow bank. They went as
quickly as they could, for they knew the need of
haste in the case of a person who had been exposed
to the cold and storm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder who he is?&rdquo; said Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoever he is he&rsquo;s pretty nearly dead,&rdquo; replied
Frank. &ldquo;I hope we&rsquo;re not too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they struggled into the lobby of the hotel
with their burden, the night clerk gazed curiously
at them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the matter?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boy almost frozen,&rdquo; replied Bart. &ldquo;Send for
a doctor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to pay him?&rdquo; the clerk inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will!&rdquo; Bart replied, somewhat indignantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, needn&rsquo;t get mad about it,&rdquo;
the clerk exclaimed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find there&rsquo;s a lot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
grafting in New York, and we have to be careful.
Here, I&rsquo;ll help you with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take him up to my room,&rdquo; Frank suggested,
as the clerk came from behind the desk and assisted
in supporting the boy, who was now unconscious.
&ldquo;Mine is the largest apartment,&rdquo; Frank
went on, &ldquo;I can bunk in with one of you fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Telephone for Dr. Smithers,&rdquo; the clerk called
to a helper as they placed the boy in the elevator.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just around the corner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lad was put to bed in Frank&rsquo;s room, and
the clerk, who seemed a little sorry, for his question
about payment, brought in some rubber hot-water
bags which were placed about the silent
form under the coverlet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must thaw him out,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
the best treatment I know of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a little while the doctor arrived. He said
the clerk had done the right thing and he ordered
some hot broth prepared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alice ought to be here,&rdquo; remarked Bart.
&ldquo;This would be just in her line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonder who he is?&rdquo; asked Frank, as the
three boys were in Bart&rsquo;s room, for the doctor,
and one of the women servants of the hotel, who
had volunteered for a nurse, were busy trying to
restore the boy to consciousness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
&ldquo;Probably some poor homeless wanderer,&rdquo; replied
Fenn. &ldquo;Tough luck, to be without a home
on a night like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only hope Ned isn&rsquo;t in any such plight,&rdquo;
spoke Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should he be?&rdquo; asked Fenn. &ldquo;He had
plenty of money when he left home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can never tell what will happen in New
York,&rdquo; replied Fenn with a wise look, which,
though he did not appreciate it, was quite a truthful
remark.</p>

<p>In about an hour Dr. Smithers came out. He
seemed well pleased with what he had accomplished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll pull him through,&rdquo; he said, rubbing
his hands. &ldquo;It was a close call. If you
had been five minutes later he would probably
have been past human aid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could he tell you anything of himself, doctor?&rdquo;
asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. He has not yet fully recovered consciousness.
But he will be pretty well in the morning,
unless something unforeseen sets in. In the
meanwhile he must be kept perfectly quiet. On
no account must he be disturbed. One of the
chambermaids will watch him during the night. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
ventured to engage her as a sort of emergency
nurse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; spoke Bart. &ldquo;You can send
the bill to me, doctor, and we&rsquo;ll pay for the nurse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s very good of you,&rdquo; Dr. Smithers
went on, &ldquo;to take so much interest in a boy
you never saw before, as I understand it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell but we might want the same kind
of help ourselves, some day,&rdquo; Frank remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; the physician agreed. &ldquo;Well,
now I believe I&rsquo;ll go. He&rsquo;ll get along all right I
think, and I&rsquo;ll look in on him in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank and Bart arranged to occupy the latter&rsquo;s
bed that night, as it was a large one. As Frank
went into his room, where the rescued boy was, to
get some clean clothing for the morning, he saw
the lad lying asleep, with the woman watching at
the head of the bed. The gas was turned low,
but a gleam from it struck on the cheek of the
sleeper. As Frank passed close by the bed he
looked down on the patient, and, as he did so, he
started. For there, on the right cheek of the boy,
was a small, but vivid red scar. Frank pointed to
it, before he knew what he was doing. The nurse,
seeing his gesture, looked up in alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That mark!&rdquo; whispered Frank. &ldquo;Is it a
cut? Did he fall and hurt himself?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an old scar,&rdquo; the woman replied in a whisper.
&ldquo;I noticed it when I was giving him some
medicine a while ago. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing much; I thought it might be a cut,&rdquo;
Frank replied as he hurried quietly from the room.
He found Bart and Fenn discussing the finding of
the boy. &ldquo;Fellows,&rdquo; began Frank suddenly as he
entered, &ldquo;do you remember Mrs. Perry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean the woman whose place we stayed
at over night out of the blizzard?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. Do you remember what she told
us about her son William who was lost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; answered Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t she say he had a scar or something on
his face?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A red scar on his right cheek,&rdquo; replied Bart.
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in there!&rdquo; declared Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you dreaming?&rdquo; asked Bart incredulously.</p>

<p>Then Frank told his chums what he had
seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course there may be other boys besides
William Perry with red scars on their right
cheeks,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sure this is the son
of the widow, in the cabin in the woods. We can
find out in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not now?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
&ldquo;Doctor said he mustn&rsquo;t be disturbed,&rdquo; Frank
replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the morning the boy was much better. The
doctor paid an early visit and pronounced him out
of danger, but advised that he be kept in bed a
day or so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you chaps who rescued him had better
go in and tell him all about it,&rdquo; the physician said
as he came from the room. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s all excited
with curiosity as to how he got here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys paid the doctor, who said he would
not have to call again unless the patient had a relapse,
and then they went into the room where the
lad was. He was sitting up in bed alone, for the
chambermaid had gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you the boys who saved me?&rdquo; was the
first question he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We pulled you out of the snow, but I guess
the doctor did the real work of saving you, William
Perry!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; almost shouted the boy in bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you William Perry? Doesn&rsquo;t your
mother live near Kirkville, and haven&rsquo;t you two
sisters, Mary and Jane?&rdquo; Frank went on earnestly,
for he had determined on a bold plan.
&ldquo;Your mother wants you to come home,&rdquo; he
added. &ldquo;Your room is all ready for you. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
told us to tell you to come back, no matter what
had happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you seen my mother?&rdquo; asked the boy,
his eyes filling with tears. &ldquo;Did she send you to
find me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you are William Perry!&rdquo; exclaimed
Bart. &ldquo;You guessed it, Frank!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We saw your mother Thanksgiving day,&rdquo; went
on Frank. &ldquo;We were able to help her. We
found her cabin just in the nick of time, for we
were caught in a blizzard. So we have only paid
back, in a measure, what she did for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am William Perry,&rdquo; the boy admitted,
and now he made no effort to conceal his tears.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve used my name, though, in
many months. My poor mother! Yes, I will go
back to her. I&rsquo;d go now, only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let the money part worry you,&rdquo; said
Fenn eagerly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll lend you some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made a big failure of it all,&rdquo; William
went on. &ldquo;I ought not to go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The more reason why you should,&rdquo; interrupted
Frank.</p>

<p>Then the waif told them his story. He had
started off to go to sea, in order to earn money for
his mother. But he only got as far as Boston.
Then, unable to stand the hard work he deserted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the ship. Fearing to go home, because he thought
he might be arrested for leaving the vessel, he
tried to find work. He did manage to get odd
jobs here and there, and finally drifted to New
York.</p>

<p>He found it was just as hard to earn a dollar
there as it had been in Boston. He could barely
get enough to buy himself food and he often went
hungry. Finally he managed to get a permanent
position, but he earned so little that he could only
just live on it. He had slept in lodging houses,
he said, and wore the poorest clothing he could
buy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was ashamed to go home without money,&rdquo;
he went on, &ldquo;or I would have gone back long ago.
I wanted to return with good clothes and gold
jingling in my pocket, as I had read, in books, of
boys doing. So I didn&rsquo;t even write to let them
know where I was. Poor mother!&rdquo; and William
sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I lost my position a month ago. Since then
I have only managed to earn enough to live, and
it was hard work at times. I hadn&rsquo;t had anything
to eat all day yesterday,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;and I was
cold and weak. I was on my way to the river,
thinking I could find a place on the wharves to
sleep, when I stumbled and fell into the snowbank.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
When I was down it felt so warm there I decided
to stay. I didn&rsquo;t care what became of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you do now, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; asked the boy eagerly. &ldquo;Say, will
you lend me a stamp so I can write home to
mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do better than that,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
send her a telegram.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the message had been forwarded to Mrs.
Perry, telling her of the unexpected finding of her
wandering boy, the three chums told the waif their
reason for being in New York.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you haven&rsquo;t been able to find a trace of
Ned, eh?&rdquo; asked William, musingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a trace,&rdquo; replied Frank. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t let
our troubles worry you. You must get strong
and hurry home to your mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, let me help you!&rdquo; exclaimed William
eagerly. &ldquo;Maybe I can pay you back for your
kindness. I know New York like a book. I&rsquo;ve
knocked all around it for the last six months.
Maybe I can locate Ned for you. I know lots of
places where fellows go when they&rsquo;re down on
their luck, as I was. Let me help. Mother won&rsquo;t
mind when I write and tell her I&rsquo;m going to stay
here a few days longer, when she knows what it&rsquo;s
for. I believe I can help you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
&ldquo;Perhaps you can,&rdquo; said Fenn.</p>

<p>So it was arranged that William was to stay
with the three chums at the hotel for a few days.
He was not to venture out until the next day, however,
as he was still weak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you be all right if we leave you alone
here?&rdquo; asked Frank a little later. &ldquo;We want to
go out and make some inquiries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. Go ahead,&rdquo; replied William. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so
happy now I&rsquo;ll not be lonesome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three chums went to police headquarters to
ask if any news concerning Ned had been received,
but there was none for them. The sergeant behind
the desk tried to cheer them up by remarking
that &ldquo;no news was good news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must find him pretty soon,&rdquo; Bart declared.
&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll begin to believe something bad
has happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they were walking along the Bowery, in the
neighborhood of the cheap variety theaters, they
were attracted by a flaming poster which announced
the various performers who could be seen
or heard. They paused and read it through.
There were men who imitated monkeys, trained
birds, strong men, women who sang, bands of musicians,
and at the bottom of the poster was the
announcement.</p>

<p class="noi center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
HEAR JOHN NEWTON, THE GREAT<br />
BIRD WHISTLER.<br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;John Newton,&rdquo; murmured Fenn. &ldquo;That
name sounds familiar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it does,&rdquo; replied Frank. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
the name of the chap who was expelled from our
high school last term.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it was. But this can&rsquo;t be the same one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it is,&rdquo; suggested Fenn. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
remember, he said he was going to New York to
be an actor? I heard he had some sort of a job
in a theater. Maybe this is he. Let&rsquo;s go in and
see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They bought tickets and entered. The whistling
was the last thing on the program, the theater
being one where a &ldquo;continuous performance&rdquo;
was given. A boy came out on the stage and began
to whistle, giving imitations of various birds.
He did very well, but the three chums were more
interested in the identity of the lad than in his
performance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is John Newton, from Darewell,&rdquo; whispered
Bart. &ldquo;I never knew he could whistle like
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was always practicing at it,&rdquo; declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Fenn, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s improved a lot since I last heard
him in Darewell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find out if we can&rsquo;t see him,&rdquo; suggested
Frank, as they went from the theater and inquired
their way back of the scenes.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>NED SHOVELS SNOW</h3>


<p>A multitude of thoughts rushed through
Ned&rsquo;s mind as he stood in the restaurant awaiting
the arrival of the policeman for whom the cashier
had sent. He could not imagine what had become
of his money. He knew his pockets had no
holes in them and he came to the conclusion he
must have dropped it on the bed in the lodging
house instead of putting it in his overcoat. But
he knew he must think of something besides the
lost money, as any moment the officer might appear
and take him to the police station.</p>

<p>He looked across the street to where a man was
shoveling snow from the sidewalk. Then a bright
idea came to Ned. He turned to the cashier who
was looking at him vindictively and asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I shovel your walk off and pay for my
breakfast that way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! That&rsquo;s a different proposition,&rdquo; the
cashier replied. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re willing to do the
square thing, I guess we are, too. Only don&rsquo;t try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
any trick like that again. I s&rsquo;pose if I let you take
a shovel you&rsquo;ll not skip out with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in the habit of stealing,&rdquo; Ned answered
indignantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about your habits,&rdquo; the
man answered. &ldquo;I only know a fellow worked
that game on me once and I don&rsquo;t intend to be
caught again. I&rsquo;ll give you thirty cents for cleaning
the walk. That&rsquo;ll pay for your meal and be
fifteen cents over. You can take it or go to jail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it,&rdquo; Ned exclaimed. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the
shovel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be watching you,&rdquo; the clerk went on. &ldquo;If
you try the sneaking act I&rsquo;ll have the cop after
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; rejoined Ned.</p>

<p>The waiter came back to report that the policeman
would be there in a few minutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go and tell him it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; the clerk said.
&ldquo;The kid&rsquo;s going to shovel the walk to pay for his
grub.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The waiter, not much relishing his second trip
through the storm, scowled at Ned as he passed
our hero, but the boy was so pleased at the escape
from his predicament that he did not mind the
waiter&rsquo;s black looks.</p>

<p>Ned made a good job of cleaning the walk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
The snow was not falling so heavily now, though
the storm was far from being over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I could get work at this if I only had
a shovel,&rdquo; Ned thought as he put the finishing
touches on his task. &ldquo;Maybe the clerk would
lend me this one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made the request when he went in to get his
pay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave the fifteen cents with you as security
for the shovel,&rdquo; he said, when he had made his request.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a hot one; fifteen cents security on a
dollar and a half shovel,&rdquo; the clerk replied with a
laugh. &ldquo;Still, you look honest, though I had my
doubts at first,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Go ahead, take the
shovel. Never mind about leaving the money.
You&rsquo;ll need it to get dinner with. Bring the
shovel back to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus was Ned started in business. He got several
jobs at cleaning sidewalks, and at noon had
earned two dollars. He went back to the restaurant,
returned the shovel and got dinner. The
cashier he had dealt with had gone, but the one
who had relieved him knew about the transaction.
When Ned had finished his fifteen cent dinner, for
that was all he allowed himself, the waitress
brought him a big piece of pie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t order that,&rdquo; he said, though he looked
at it longingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cashier says it&rsquo;s his treat,&rdquo; the girl replied
with a smile, and Ned had no further compunctions
about eating it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told the other fellow you wouldn&rsquo;t bring the
shovel back,&rdquo; the cashier remarked as Ned paid
his check.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why the clerk, who was on duty here when you
ate breakfast, said he thought you would, and I
said I didn&rsquo;t believe you would show up again.
I said if you did I&rsquo;d give you some pie. See?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Ned answered with a laugh, &ldquo;much
obliged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That afternoon he bought a second-hand shovel
and went about looking for more walks to clean.
By night he had earned a dollar additional, which
gave him considerable more capital than he had
possessed since the episode at the hotel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get a room at the lodging house to-night,&rdquo;
he said as he finished a simple supper. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
like those beds all in a heap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was still snowing the next day, and though
Ned found the field pretty well covered by scores
of other men and boys, he managed to earn two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
dollars, which made him feel quite like a capitalist,
as he shut the door of his lodging-house room that
night.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The three chums, who wanted to find John
Newton had no trouble. They met him coming
from the rear of the theater, as he had done his
&ldquo;turn,&rdquo; and was not to go on again for three
hours.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Bird Warbler&rdquo; was as much surprised
to see his former acquaintances from Darewell as
they were to find him engaged at a theater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m studying to be an actor,&rdquo; John said, &ldquo;but
it&rsquo;s dull times now and I took this job. It pays
pretty well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never knew you could whistle good enough
for this work,&rdquo; said Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It comes natural I guess,&rdquo; replied John.
&ldquo;But what are you chaps doing in New York?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They told him, and Bart suggested that perhaps
John might happen to see Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I do I&rsquo;ll let you know,&rdquo; the &ldquo;warbler&rdquo;
replied. &ldquo;Where are you stopping?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the Imperial,&rdquo; replied Bart. &ldquo;You might
telephone us if you hear anything of Ned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will. Come and have a glass of soda with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
me,&rdquo; John added, but the chums were too anxious
to keep on with their search to accept, and, bidding
the &ldquo;warbler&rdquo; good-bye they kept on.</p>

<p>They got back to their rooms at noon, to find
that William Perry was up and dressed, and impatient
to go out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to begin to help you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Did
you see the clerk when you came in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Why?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s anxious to tell you something. Says
they opened a valise a fellow left here and he
thinks it might contain a clew that would help
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s about Ned,&rdquo; suggested Bart.
&ldquo;Come on fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say the name of your missing
friend was?&rdquo; the clerk asked them, as the three
chums hurried down to his desk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ned Wilding,&rdquo; answered Frank. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You remember me telling you about that fellow
who slipped down the fire escape rope and lost
his valise?&rdquo; the clerk asked. The boys said they
did. &ldquo;Well, we opened it to-day, and the collars
are marked &lsquo;N. W.&rsquo; I thought it might be a tip
for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see the things in the satchel,&rdquo; suggested
Fenn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
The clerk showed them to the chums. They
had no difficulty in identifying as Ned&rsquo;s several
articles in the valise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then that writing was his, after all!&rdquo; exclaimed
Frank. &ldquo;Boys, we are on his track.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where can he be?&rdquo; asked Bart. &ldquo;We
only know he ran away from here. Why did he
leave in that fashion? Had he done something
he was afraid of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he suddenly went&mdash;&rdquo; began Frank,
and then he stopped in seeming confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were you going to say?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Frank replied. &ldquo;I made a mistake.
I think we&rsquo;d better tell the police about
this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. I nearly forgot,&rdquo; the clerk added.
&ldquo;You are to go to police headquarters. A message
came over the telephone a little while ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they&rsquo;ve found Ned!&rdquo; exclaimed
Bart for they had left the telephone number of
their hotel with the sergeant at headquarters and
the official had promised he would telephone if he
had any news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry up!&rdquo; cried Fenn. &ldquo;Perhaps Ned is
there waiting for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only hope he is,&rdquo; Frank remarked, and the
boys noticed he appeared gloomy and sad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
&ldquo;Wonder what ails Frank?&rdquo; asked Bart of
Fenn, as they went to their rooms to get their coats
and hats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fit of the same old mysteriousness,&rdquo; replied
Stumpy. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t notice him and it will pass
over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me go to headquarters with you,&rdquo; begged
William. &ldquo;I want to help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you strong enough to go out?&rdquo; asked
Bart. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m used to that,&rdquo; and the boy laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&mdash;er&mdash;you have no overcoat,&rdquo; said
Fenn, wishing when it was too late he had not
mentioned it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m used to that too,&rdquo; William replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you mind if we loaned you money
enough to get a coat?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>William thought for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ever so much obliged to you,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done more for me now than I can ever
repay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then a little more won&rsquo;t hurt,&rdquo; said Fenn
with a laugh.</p>

<p>The overcoat was purchased, and the four boys
went to police headquarters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentleman waiting to see you,&rdquo; the sergeant
said. &ldquo;Seems terribly upset about something.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
They went into an anteroom and found Mr.
Wilding. He had been in New York since early
Thursday morning, but had been unable to locate
the boys, since the finding of William in the snow
had taken from the minds of the three chums all
thoughts of sending the telegram to Darewell,
telling Ned&rsquo;s father of their address.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew there was something we should have
attended to, but I couldn&rsquo;t think what it was,&rdquo; Bart
exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any news?&rdquo; asked Mr. Wilding
eagerly after explaining he had obtained the address
of the chums from the police sergeant who
offered to telephone to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a little,&rdquo; replied Fenn and he told of the
finding of Ned&rsquo;s valise. Then all went over the
situation, but the prospect seemed no brighter than
ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what we ought to do,&rdquo; declared
William.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Mr. Wilding anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We ought to make a regular search of all the
lodging houses and other places. I&rsquo;ve slept in lots
of &rsquo;em. That&rsquo;s where men and boys go when they
have only a little money, and I guess your son
hadn&rsquo;t much when he lost his valise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re right!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
father. &ldquo;It is a good suggestion. I will hire
some private detectives to help in the search.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll do all I can,&rdquo; said William, whose
story had been told to Mr. Wilding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My poor boy,&rdquo; Ned&rsquo;s father murmured. &ldquo;I
wonder where he can be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you fret!&rdquo; exclaimed William.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find him for you,&rdquo; and he spoke so hopefully
that Mr. Wilding smiled for the first time
since he had left home.</p>

<p>It was arranged that he would stay at a hotel
near police headquarters while the four boys would
remain at the Imperial as there was a bare chance
Ned would return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now here&rsquo;s where I get busy,&rdquo; declared William,
as they left the police station.</p>

<h3>CASSIDY CATCHES NED</h3>


<p>A systematic search of the lodging houses was
begun that afternoon. But it was harder and
more baffling work than any one had imagined.</p>

<p>John Newton gave them unexpected aid. As
he had much time to himself he offered to go with
them to the different lodging houses in the evenings,
and give his whistling imitations of birds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What good will that do?&rdquo; asked Bart.
&ldquo;Does he think Ned will hear him and come from
hiding?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that,&rdquo; explained Fenn, to whom John had
told his scheme. &ldquo;But when he&rsquo;s whistling there&rsquo;s
sure to be a crowd around him, and, if Ned is in
the place, he&rsquo;ll join the others and we may see him.
I think it&rsquo;s a good plan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others did also, and, for several evenings
John amused the inmates of the lodging houses
with his whistling. As Fenn had said, crowds
gathered about him, and the three chums looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
eagerly through them for a sight of Ned.</p>

<p>It was perhaps one of the best plans the boys
could have adopted, for in their eagerness to hear
the &ldquo;Bird Warbler&rdquo; the unfortunate lads and
men who were forced to the shelter of the places
crowded close up around John Newton. In this
way Bart and his companions could scrutinize at
short range nearly every person in the throng.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you getting tired of it?&rdquo; asked Bart
one evening when they were starting out for a
large lodging house on the Bowery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind it a bit,&rdquo; replied John. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
do more than this to help find Ned. Besides, it&rsquo;s
a good advertisement for me. You see the fellows
in these places hear me, and when they see
my name on the theatrical bill boards they&rsquo;ll come
in. You can&rsquo;t get too much advertising when
you&rsquo;re an actor,&rdquo; and John looked quite important.</p>

<p>There was a larger crowd than usual in the
lodging house that night. John made his way
to the front of the room. At first no one paid
any attention to the entrance of himself and his
friends. But, as soon as John began an imitation
of a mocking bird, there was a stir.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sounds just like it used to when I was
a boy!&rdquo; exclaimed an old man. &ldquo;Many and
many&rsquo;s the mornin&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve heard them birds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Can you do a song-sparrow imitation, sonny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; replied John, and he trilled some sweet
high notes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My but that&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>From that John proceeded to imitate a robin
and a bob-o-link. He had scarcely finished with
the last before there was a stir in one corner of
the room. It seemed as if some one was trying
to get out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe Ned&rsquo;s there!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart to Fenn.
&ldquo;Go over and take a look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fenn edged his way through the crowd, but
found, instead of some one trying to get out, it
was a man trying to make his way closer to where
the whistler was. From his appearance the man
seemed to have just awakened from a sound sleep
on a couple of chairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Let me
get at &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked several.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to catch those birds!&rdquo; the recently
awakened sleeper said, rubbing his eyes. &ldquo;I can
put &rsquo;em in cages and sell &rsquo;em. I haven&rsquo;t made
any money lately, now&rsquo;s my chance. Get out of
my way, can&rsquo;t you? I used to trap birds when I
was a boy. These are fine singers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John had not yet caught sight of the man making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
his way toward him. The &ldquo;Warbler&rdquo; was
giving an imitation of a blackbird, and he managed
to send out his notes with such skill that it
really sounded as if the bird was in a different
part of the room from where the whistler stood.
The notes appeared to come from a window in
the corner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can get him! Look out!&rdquo; cried the man.</p>

<p>He made a dash for the window, and at that,
John, who was now aware of what was going on,
changed the whistling to the notes of a bluebird.</p>

<p>This time the tones were so directed as to seem
to come from a window on the other side of the
room, and the man turned to make a dash in that
direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s two birds!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll catch &rsquo;em all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>No sooner had he reached the second window
than John changed the tune to that made by a
bullfinch, and the man, listening, thought the bird
was in the back of the apartment. He made his
way there, the crowd parting to let him through,
and laughing, the meanwhile, at the deluded man&rsquo;s
actions.</p>

<p>John was concealed from view by the throng
packed close about him, or the man would have
discovered the trick at once. As it was he thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
sure there were several birds in the room. When
he got to the rear the notes of the feathered songster
seemed more distinct than ever. The man
climbed up on a chair to peer behind the window
curtain, and, as he did so, John, whose vocal abilities
were not alone limited to birds, let out a
croak like a big frog.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no bird!&rdquo; exclaimed the man in disgust,
as the crowd broke into a laugh at him.
&ldquo;Am I dreaming or what&rsquo;s the matter? Is this
place haunted?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he caught sight of John, who was just
puckering up his lips to again imitate a bird.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, is it?&rdquo; the man exclaimed.
&ldquo;Well you&rsquo;re a good one, all right, to fool me.
I used to live in the woods and I know birds
pretty well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I learned to imitate &rsquo;em; in the
woods,&rdquo; said John, glad of a chance to rest, for
his lips and mouth were aching from the strain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you whistle tunes?&rdquo; the man asked him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give us some music then. I like a good
jolly song; and we&rsquo;ll join in the chorus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then John poured forth his melody in a series
of popular songs, for he was a good whistler,
aside from his power to mimic, and, for half an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
hour the lodging house rang with the voices of the
men, led by John&rsquo;s shrill notes.</p>

<p>All this while Bart and the others kept a close
lookout for Ned. They did not see him, and,
when it was evident that all the inmates of the
place had come under their scrutiny, the boys left,
their mission unsuccessful. And so it was for several
evenings.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ned, all unconscious of the search
being made for him, was puzzling his brains as to
what he had better do. He was in no immediate
danger of starving, as there were several snowstorms,
and he earned enough to pay for his room
and live frugally. Still he knew his father and
chums would worry but he did not feel he dare
communicate with them. He bought the papers
each day, and saw several references to the swindling
operations of Skem &amp; Skim. They had not
been arrested yet, it stated, and search was being
made for them and for a young fellow who was
believed to have helped them in their operations by
dealing in a number of shares of oil stock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That means me,&rdquo; thought Ned, as he read it.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to lay low yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he went his weary way, fearing arrest every
moment, yet feeling rather secure now that a week
had passed and he had not been apprehended. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
found several odd jobs to do when there was no
snow to shovel and so managed to make enough to
live on.</p>

<p>The four boys and Mr. Wilding kept up their
search. The police and private detectives did
what they could but to no purpose. Personals
were inserted in the papers, begging Ned to communicate
with his father, but Ned never thought
of looking for them.</p>

<p>One afternoon, William, who had adopted the
plan of walking about the streets in the hope of
seeing Ned, whom he knew by description and a
photograph, paused in front of a commission store,
where a youth about his own age was helping to
move boxes of oranges from a truck. Something
about the lad attracted William&rsquo;s attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if that&rsquo;s Ned?&rdquo; he said to himself.
&ldquo;He looks just like the boys told me he would and
like that photograph Mr. Wilding had. Still I
wouldn&rsquo;t like to make a mistake. I must get
closer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pretended to be searching for a number on
the building, and so approached near to the boy
helping unload the crates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet it is Ned,&rdquo; William said to himself
with conviction. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to ask him. He
can&rsquo;t any more than say no.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
He sauntered up to the young fellow, and, with
an air of unconcern asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know anyone around here named Ned
Wilding? I&rsquo;m looking for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy, carrying a crate of oranges, jumped
so he almost dropped the fruit. Then he looked
sharply at William. His face grew pale, and William
was sure he had found Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got time to talk,&rdquo; was the rather gruff
answer made by the boy with the crate. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
busy,&rdquo; and then he hurried into the store with the
box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fooled again,&rdquo; thought William. He waited
until the boy came out again, and this time he was
sure it was the missing youth. But now he decided
on a different plan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evidently, if it is Ned, he doesn&rsquo;t want to be
known,&rdquo; thought William. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s gone
wrong with him. My only chance is in getting
some of his chums here to identify him. I
must telephone to one of them. They may be at
the hotel. If not I&rsquo;ll leave word for them to
come here as soon as they get back. Mr. Wilding
too! I must &rsquo;phone him! Then I&rsquo;ll remain on
the watch until some one arrives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a telephone pay-station across the
street, and William sent his two messages from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
there. Neither of the three chums was in, nor was
Mr. Wilding, but at both hotels the clerks said
they would deliver the messages promptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now to wait until they come,&rdquo; said William
as he left the booth.</p>

<p>Just then, as he was looking at the boy, who
was still carrying in the crates, he saw a big man
with a red moustache approach him. William
was not near enough to hear what the man said,
but he noted that the boy seemed frightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah I&rsquo;ve caught you, haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; exclaimed
the man, and Ned (for as William suspected the
boy carrying in the oranges was the missing
youth) looked up with a start. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you
to steal my money and run away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He grabbed Ned by the arm and shook him
roughly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t take your money, Mr. Cassidy!&rdquo; exclaimed
the boy, as he recognized the lodging
house keeper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you run away for? I&rsquo;m on to your
game. Now you can come along with me and
work out what you stole from me, or I&rsquo;ll hand you
over to the first officer I meet. What are you
going to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>What was poor Ned to do? He was in dire
straits. Still it seemed better to go with Cassidy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
than to make a scene on the street and be arrested.
He wanted that least of all things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;though you have
no right to make me, and I didn&rsquo;t take your
money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked the fruit man,
who had hired Ned to assist in unloading the
truck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing much,&rdquo; replied Cassidy. &ldquo;This lad
owes me some money and I&rsquo;ll make him work it
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your affair,&rdquo; the fruit man replied.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s earned half a dollar working for me.
Here it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was about to hand it to Ned, but Cassidy
took it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll apply that on account,&rdquo; he said grimly,
as he marched Ned away.</p>

<p>The whole affair had occurred so suddenly that
Ned did not know what to do. He was in a sort
of dream. The appearance of Cassidy, the confiscation
of the half dollar and the lodging house
keeper&rsquo;s evident intention of holding the boy to
account for a theft he had never committed, made
Ned think he was doomed to misfortune, no matter
what he did to avoid it.</p>

<p>Then followed a natural desire to escape. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
knew Cassidy had no right to take him into custody,
and he felt the injustice of it keenly. The
man held him loosely by the coat sleeve, and
marched him along through the streets. Several
persons turned to look at the spectacle, but no
one ventured to interfere. New Yorkers have
formed the habit of not taking much interest in
affairs that do not concern them directly.</p>

<p>As they were crossing a narrow street in one
of the thickly settled tenement districts a horse,
attached to a wagon, and rapidly driven, bore
down on them. Ned, with the instinct of a quick
runner, started to dash ahead. Cassidy, who
moved slower, pulled back toward the curb, to
let the steed pass. The movement separated Ned
from his captor, for Cassidy&rsquo;s hold on the boy&rsquo;s
sleeve was broken. Ned was free!</p>

<p>The horse and wagon was now between him
and the man. The boy gave a hasty glance back,
and saw Cassidy standing on the crossing, ready
to dash forward as soon as the wagon should pass.
He could not go around it because of vehicles
on either side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my chance!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned as he
dashed forward and ran down the other side of
the street.</p>

<p>An instant later the wagon had passed and Cassidy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
was after him. But the start Ned had he
used to good advantage. He was fleet of foot
and he had an object in making speed, such as he
had never had before. Somewhat to his surprise
Cassidy did not shout to him to stop, and made
no outcry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if he&rsquo;s afraid to let people know
he&rsquo;s after me?&rdquo; thought Ned.</p>

<p>The truth of it was, Cassidy wanted to save
his breath for running. Also, he did not want
to raise too much disturbance in his pursuit of
Ned. He knew he had no right to take the boy
into custody, and, though he knew he could cause
his arrest on the false charge, that would not
bring back the money Cassidy thought Ned had
stolen. It was the money, or its equivalent, the
lodging house keeper was after.</p>

<p>So he decided to try to catch Ned without aid
from outside sources if possible. With this in
view he started after the fugitive without raising
an alarm, though the streets were well filled.</p>

<p>Ned made good time. He speeded down the
thoroughfare until he came to where another intersected
it, and turned the corner. This put him
out of Cassidy&rsquo;s view.</p>

<p>The second street was not so thronged as the
one he had just left, and Ned had a chance to run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
better. But there was this disadvantage, that he
was more closely observed. On the crowded avenue
a running lad attracts little attention, but when
more plainly in sight, as Ned now was, he becomes
an object of interest.</p>

<p>As he ran he looked back over his shoulder to
see if Cassidy was in sight. Past several houses
Ned kept on, and his pursuer did not appear
around the corner. Then, just as he came in
front of a big tenement house Ned saw Cassidy
some distance in the rear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll go in here!&rdquo; thought the boy.
&ldquo;Maybe I can slip out of the back before he gets
here and that will fool him. I&rsquo;m going to try!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He darted into the hallway, but, before he had
gone three steps he collided with an old man who,
at that instant, was coming from his room into
the corridor. The shock threw the old man down,
and Ned could scarcely retain his balance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me!&rdquo; he exclaimed, pausing, when he
had recovered his equilibrium, to help the aged
man to his feet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; and then he
started to run through the hallway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here! Vait a minute!&rdquo; the man exclaimed.
&ldquo;Are you tryin&rsquo; to rob me? I dinks you are a
t&rsquo;eef! Hold on! Vait until I see if you haf
taken my vatch!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t taken anything of yours!&rdquo; cried
Ned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a hurry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was almost at the end of the hall, and saw
that it opened into a sort of court. Abutting on
that was another tenement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vait! You vas a t&rsquo;eef!&rdquo; cried the old man,
and he set up such a yelling that doors on either
side of the corridor opened, and men and women
stuck their heads forth, all demanding to know
what the matter was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m done for now!&rdquo; thought Ned. &ldquo;If Cassidy
comes past here he&rsquo;ll be sure to hear the excitement,
and they&rsquo;ll tell him I ran through!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still he determined not to give up. He dashed
on into the court, leaving behind the aged man
who was now the centre of an excited throng.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He vos a t&rsquo;eef! He knocked me down! He
vouldn&rsquo;t vait until I looked to see if I am robbed!&rdquo;
was the burden of the aged one&rsquo;s cry. &ldquo;Call de
police! He vos a t&rsquo;eef!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned ran across the open space and into the
other tenement house. The hallway there seemed
deserted, but he knew it would not be so long,
when the cries from the other house had aroused
the inmates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I can only get through the corridor, and
into the other street I can fool Cassidy,&rdquo; Ned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
reasoned. &ldquo;I seem to be having all my bad luck
at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had almost reached the front door, for it
was the back entrance of the structure that he
had gone in, and he thought he saw freedom before
him, when there sounded behind him a cry of:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop thief! Stop thief!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is enough to arouse excitement anywhere,
but in a New York tenement nothing can sooner
be calculated to draw the inmates from their rooms,
than such an alarm, unless, indeed, it be one of fire.</p>

<p>No sooner had the first cry resounded through
the corridor than the hall was swarming with people.
Ned found his way blocked, the more effectually
when one woman ran to the front door
and closed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve caught you!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach
you to rob honest people, even if they are poor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t robbed anybody!&rdquo; cried Ned, as he
saw the throng in front of him, and heard the
tramp of many feet in his rear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop him! Hold him!&rdquo; cried half a score.</p>

<p>Ned looked about him. There seemed to be
no way of escape. He was standing near the
flight of stairs leading to the upper stories of
the second tenement. There was a little clear
space in front of him, as the crowd before him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
was composed mostly of women, who were a little
timid about approaching too closely to a &ldquo;thief&rdquo;
even if he was only a lad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to chance it,&rdquo; thought Ned. &ldquo;If
I can get to the roof I can cross to some other
house, and go down a scuttle hole, perhaps, and
so reach the street. Or I can hide until the excitement
blows over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this in mind he suddenly grasped the
balustrade near which he was. With a jump and
a swing he was over it and part way up the stairs.
Then he began to run, while the crowd below
him, surprised at his sudden escape, set up a chorus
of yells.</p>

<p>But Ned had a good start. He took the steps
three at a time, and was soon at the top. Then
he essayed the next flight, and so on until he found
himself on the roof, which was a big, wide stretch
of tin. It was used as a place for hanging out
clothes, and was easy of access from the top hallway.</p>

<p>Below him Ned could hear the shouts and cries,
and the tramp of many feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which way shall I go?&rdquo; he asked himself, as
he paused for an instant. &ldquo;Guess it can&rsquo;t make
much difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned to the left and ran along until he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
came to a stairway several houses further along.
The door of this was open, and he went down.
He had fairly distanced his pursuers, for none
of them were yet on the roof.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get to the street and leave &rsquo;em behind,&rdquo;
the boy reasoned. &ldquo;Everyone will be in the
house looking for me, and the street will be deserted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this Ned was almost right, for when, after
hurrying down several flights of stairs, he reached
the thoroughfare, the only person in sight in the
immediate neighborhood was a colored man putting
in coal. He seemed to be so busily engaged
that he had no time to waste in pursuit, so, after
a hasty glance from the front door of the tenement,
Ned went out.</p>

<p>But in this he reckoned without his host. The
colored man, looking up from his shoveling, saw
Ned. The lad&rsquo;s wild and disheveled appearance
raised the man&rsquo;s suspicions. Besides he had heard
of the chase after the thief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cotch you!&rdquo; he cried, leaping from his
wagon. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned, who was, by this time, running past where
the coal wagon was backed up to the curb, turned
out to avoid the negro, who, with outstretched
arms was advancing toward him. In his anxiety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
to avoid the coal man, Ned did not notice an
open hole down which the black diamonds were
being shoveled. Before he could save himself
he had plunged into it.</p>

<p>Lucky for the boy the cellar underneath was
almost full, the coal coming to within a few feet
of the sidewalk, so when Ned toppled in he only
went down a little ways. There he was, his head
and shoulders sticking up above the pavement,
while his feet and legs were buried in the pile of
coal underneath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve got you!&rdquo; yelled the colored man,
as he ran up to Ned, and hauled him from the
hole. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you! What&rsquo;d you steal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t steal anything,&rdquo; Ned answered.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a mistake. Please let me go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold him!&rdquo; cried Cassidy, appearing at that
moment from the front entrance of the house, up
the stairs of which Ned had dashed a few minutes
before. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him get away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll not get away,&rdquo; replied the negro.</p>

<p>Cassidy came up and took charge of Ned.
Quite a crowd gathered, but the lodging house
keeper answered none of the many questions asked
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess he&rsquo;s a detective,&rdquo; was the general whisper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
that went around, and Cassidy did not correct
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You come with me!&rdquo; he said to Ned.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try any of your tricks again, or it&rsquo;ll be
the worse for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he marched Ned off.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<h3>BAFFLED AGAIN</h3>


<p>William, coming across the street to take up a
position, where he could watch the lad he suspected
was Ned, puzzled his head over the scene
he had just witnessed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what he went off with that man
for?&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t act as though
he wanted to, either. I&rsquo;ll ask the fruit man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He approached, and then the thought struck it
would be a good idea to apply for the job the other
boy had just left. He got it, for there was need
of hurry in unloading the fruit, as the day was
cold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the matter with the other fellow?&rdquo;
asked William carelessly as though it was of little
moment to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the fruit man replied. &ldquo;The
boy came along just like you and asked for a job.
I hired him and then along comes this fellow and
says the lad owes him money. It wasn&rsquo;t any of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
my affair. Hustle those boxes in now, I don&rsquo;t
want the oranges to freeze.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was the man who took him away?&rdquo;
asked William, as indifferently as he could, though
he was nervous with eagerness to hear the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never saw him before. It was none of my
affair, though I liked the looks of that boy, and I
didn&rsquo;t care much for the man. But I&rsquo;ve gotten
over the habit of interfering in other people&rsquo;s business.
Come now, boy, hustle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>William went to work with an energy that
pleased his employer. The boy was beginning to
think he had made a mistake. He felt that he
should have followed the man, to see where he
took the lad he believed was Ned. But then, too,
he had telephoned Mr. Wilding and the chums
to meet him at the fruit store, and if he was not
there when they arrived, they would not know
what to make of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be in two places at once,&rdquo; William
thought to himself. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;d better stay here
until some one comes. Then maybe I can trace
which way the man took the boy. Anyhow I&rsquo;m
not sure it was Ned. I&rsquo;ve never seen him, and it
wouldn&rsquo;t do to make a mistake. He wouldn&rsquo;t
admit he was Ned Wilding, but he acted to me as
though he was afraid of something.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Thus musing, and puzzling over whether he
had done the right thing, William continued to
help unload the truck, keeping a sharp lookout for
Mr. Wilding or the three chums.</p>

<p>The three boys arrived first. They came down
the street in a hurry looking for the place William
had described to the hotel clerk over the telephone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; cried Bart, as he caught sight
of the boy they had pulled from the snow drift.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Ned?&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure it was him,&rdquo; William replied,
&ldquo;but a man came and took him away half an hour
ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he rapidly explained what had taken place,
describing the boy he had seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Ned sure enough,&rdquo; Fenn exclaimed.
&ldquo;Where in the world could he have gone to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who was the man who said Ned owed
him money?&rdquo; asked Frank. &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re on
the trail of the mystery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry up, let&rsquo;s see if we can&rsquo;t find them,&rdquo;
suggested Bart. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t have gone very
far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of us ought to stay here to meet Mr.
Wilding if he comes,&rdquo; said Fenn. &ldquo;The other
two can go with William to look for Ned and
the man.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
&ldquo;Say, did I hire you to chin or to carry in
oranges?&rdquo; asked the fruit man, suddenly appearing
in the doorway, and noting William talking to
the three boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll have to give up the job,&rdquo; replied
William. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go with these boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, there must be a hoodoo about this job,&rdquo;
the fruit man exclaimed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the second boy
to give it up in less than an hour. What&rsquo;s the
matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys did not think it necessary to explain.
It was arranged that Frank would stay in the
vicinity of the store to meet Mr. Wilding, if that
gentleman should arrive, and tell what had happened,
while William, with Bart and Fenn, tried
to trace Ned and the red-moustached man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Mr. Wilding comes I&rsquo;ll take him to our
hotel,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;There will be no use in remaining
here and we can wait for you there, as it&rsquo;s
nearer than his.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; replied Bart. &ldquo;We may have
some good news for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you do,&rdquo; Frank said. &ldquo;This thing is
getting on my nerves. I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ll never see
Ned again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes we will,&rdquo; put in Fenn cheerfully.</p>

<p>William did not stop to ask any pay from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
fruit man for what work he had done, but hurried
off with the two chums in the direction taken by
Ned and the man who had led him away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll ask any policeman we meet,&rdquo; suggested
Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re on a sort of wild-goose
chase,&rdquo; remarked William, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s the best we
can do. If I had only been sure it was Ned I
would have followed him, without waiting for you,
but I wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it was Ned,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand
why he didn&rsquo;t admit his identity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must have had a good reason for it,&rdquo; retorted
Fenn.</p>

<p>Through the street they hurried, making inquiries
from policemen, and others whom they met, as
to whether Ned and the man had gone that way.
They got some traces, but in New York few persons,
even policemen, have time to take note of
those whom they have no special reason for keeping
in mind. As William had said, it was a sort
of wild-goose chase, and, when they had gone a
mile or more, they became convinced that it was
useless to continue any farther.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baffled again,&rdquo; remarked Bart. &ldquo;This beats
me. I wonder what we are to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have to begin all over again,&rdquo; declared William.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
&ldquo;It was my fault. I should have followed
Ned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you did what you thought was best,&rdquo;
Fenn replied.</p>

<p>They returned to the hotel, to find Mr. Wilding
and Frank awaiting them. Mr. Wilding, who
had expected some news of his son, was deeply disappointed
when the three boys returned with none.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in the world are we to do?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Wilding. &ldquo;We seem completely at a loss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are a few more lodging houses to try,&rdquo;
suggested William. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll start out again this
evening. That&rsquo;s when the places are full, and I
may get some trace of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one could offer a better suggestion, and it
was arranged that Mr. Wilding should continue
the search with a private detective he had hired,
while William and Bart would make a tour of the
lodging houses. Fenn and Frank were to remain
at the Imperial Hotel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no telling when a message may come
from the baggage agent telling us that Ned has
called for his trunk,&rdquo; Bart said, &ldquo;and some one
ought to be ready to hurry to the depot. We&rsquo;ll
have to divide our forces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With little hope in their hearts, but with dogged
patience, and a determination to keep up the
search, William and Bart started out.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<h3>NED A PRISONER</h3>


<p>Ned followed Cassidy through the streets, the
lodging-house keeper leading the way, and seemingly
in no fear that the boy would give him the
slip. As a matter of fact, Ned did not intend to
try to escape. He was, in a sense, a voluntary
prisoner now, as he knew, if he tried to run away
again, Cassidy would probably take after him and
raise such a disturbance that the police would interfere.
And Ned had his own reasons for not
wanting anything to do with the bluecoats.</p>

<p>Afterwards he thought how senseless, in a measure,
his fears were, but at the time they loomed
up large before him, and caused him to do things
of which, otherwise, he would not have dreamed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry up!&rdquo; exclaimed Cassidy when he and
Ned had been walking about half an hour. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t got all day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you intend to do?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I intend to make you work out the value of
the money you stole from me. One of my porters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
has left and I have to have another. Instead of
hiring one I&rsquo;ll make you do the work until you
square things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never took your money!&rdquo; declared Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve said that several times,&rdquo; Cassidy exclaimed.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear it again. I saw
you, but I&rsquo;m willing to give you a chance to reform.
No use calling in the police unless I have
to, but I will, if you don&rsquo;t do as I tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man spoke earnestly, and not unkindly, and
Ned began to believe that Cassidy really believed
he stole the money, a thing the boy had not admitted
at first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some day you&rsquo;ll find you&rsquo;re wrong,&rdquo; Ned said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess not! Jim Cassidy doesn&rsquo;t make mistakes,&rdquo;
was the answer. &ldquo;If I do I&rsquo;ll pay you
back with interest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They reached the lodging house where Ned had
stopped before, and whence he had escaped in the
night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go ahead up,&rdquo; commanded Cassidy. &ldquo;Get a
broom and a pail of water and scrub out the rooms.
I&rsquo;ll allow you at the rate of a dollar and a half
a day. I had fifteen dollars under my pillow that
you took. I got four and a half of it back, counting
the fifty cents from the fruit man, and that
leaves ten dollars and a half you owe me. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
work seven days and I&rsquo;ll call it square, and give
you your bed free at night. That&rsquo;s more than
you deserve, but you&rsquo;re young and I&rsquo;ll give you a
chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned thought it was a pretty poor chance, considering
his innocence of the theft, but he decided
it was best not to answer. He got a pail and
broom, and, taking off his coat set to work cleaning
the dirty floor. Cassidy watched him a while
in silence and remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be on the lookout, so don&rsquo;t try to sneak
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll work my seven days,&rdquo; Ned replied, trying
to hide the tears that would persist in coming
into his eyes. As he labored away the stock certificate,
in his inside pocket, rustled. All his trouble
dated from the acquisition of that, he reflected
bitterly, and it was a dearly bought bit of experience.</p>

<p>All that afternoon Ned worked away, his heart
like lead. He longed for a sight of the faces of
his chums, and he wanted to hear from his father.
It seemed a very long time since he had left Darewell
so happy and filled with expectations of the
pleasures he and his friends would enjoy in New
York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
&ldquo;I wonder if the boys came?&rdquo; Ned thought.
&ldquo;I wonder what my father must think? Oh, I&rsquo;ve
a good notion to write to him and ask him what to
do! I can&rsquo;t stand it any longer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned was on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
He had stood about all he could, and with the poor
food and the bad sleeping places, which were all
he could afford, his health was in danger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come now, no loafing!&rdquo; exclaimed Cassidy&rsquo;s
coarse voice, as Ned paused a moment in his scrubbing.
&ldquo;When I pay a dollar and a half a day
I expect good, quick work. We don&rsquo;t want any
idlers around here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wearily Ned began to move the wet broom over
the dirty boards. There were a number of unkempt
men engaged in the same occupation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If my chums should see me now,&rdquo; thought
Ned.</p>

<p>He expected to be allowed to go to bed early
as he was tired, but when Cassidy had sent him
to a near-by, cheap restaurant, in company with
one of the other porters, for supper, Ned found,
on his return, that he was expected to clean out
the office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten o&rsquo;clock&rsquo;s time enough to go to bed,&rdquo; Cassidy
told him. &ldquo;The work got behind when my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
other man left and it&rsquo;s got to be made up. I don&rsquo;t
want the Board of Health here, condemning the
place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even with all the cleaning that was done, it
looked as if the Board should take some action,
Ned thought.</p>

<p>Meanwhile William and Bart had, that same
evening, visited several lodging houses. They
met with no success, though the proprietors described
boys who bore a resemblance to Ned, but
who had only stopped one night and had then disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find him,&rdquo; said William, more cheerfully
than he felt.</p>

<p>The two boys were walking down a side street,
approaching a lodging-house they intended to
visit. It was one they had not yet inspected. It
was about eight o&rsquo;clock and was blowing up cold.
There was a feeling of snow in the air, and the
boys buttoned their coats closely around them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hope Ned doesn&rsquo;t have to stay out in the
storm like I did,&rdquo; said William.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; chimed in Bart. &ldquo;I hate to think
about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try this place,&rdquo; William went on, as
they reached the entrance to the lodging house.
In the hallway a gas jet burned, and, as the lads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
started up the stairs, they met a red moustached
man coming down. At the sight of him William
cried out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There he is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man who took Ned away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next instant the two boys were besieging
Cassidy with questions. The lodging-house proprietor
looked bewildered a moment, and then,
gathering the import of what they wanted, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re chums of his, eh? Belong to the
same gang I s&rsquo;pose? Well, you can&rsquo;t come any
tricks on me! If that lad is your chum he stays
here until he&rsquo;s worked out what he owes me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does he owe you?&rdquo; demanded Bart.
&ldquo;Ned Wilding doesn&rsquo;t need to owe anyone anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He owes me the money he stole!&rdquo; Cassidy
cried, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m going to get it! Now, you fellows
skip out of here or I&rsquo;ll call the police!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we see Ned?&rdquo; demanded William.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t! He&rsquo;s got to stay here a week.
Think I&rsquo;m going to let you in and have you help
him git away the way he did after he took my
money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He never took your money!&rdquo; cried Bart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
&ldquo;Clear out!&rdquo; exclaimed Cassidy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bart, you go get a policeman!&rdquo; called William
suddenly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about this thing.
Telephone for Mr. Wilding and the boys!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay on guard!&rdquo; William replied, looking
Cassidy straight in the face. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not going
to get Ned away from me again!&rdquo;</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<h3>NED IS FOUND&mdash;CONCLUSION</h3>


<p>Bart hurried down the stairs. Cassidy looked
after him, a little in doubt what to make of the
proceeding. Then he glanced at William.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, you get out of this!&rdquo; he called roughly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed William cheerfully. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
your place, I admit, but you&rsquo;ll sing a different tune
pretty soon. I&rsquo;ll get out of the hallway but the
street is free, and I&rsquo;ll be on guard there until this
thing is settled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too fresh!&rdquo; spluttered Cassidy, as he
turned and went back upstairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right! You&rsquo;ll get what&rsquo;s coming
to you pretty soon,&rdquo; retorted William confidently,
as he went down to the street to await the return
of Bart with reinforcements.</p>

<p>Bart soon got into communication with Mr.
Wilding, and with the two chums, at their hotel.
They said they would hurry to the lodging house,
and Mr. Wilding announced that he would bring a
detective from headquarters, rather than have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
boys ask a policeman to investigate the matter.
Meanwhile, Mr. Wilding advised Bart to keep
close watch on the lodging house.</p>

<p>William and Bart now took up their positions
where they could observe the entrance to the place.
They did not know there was a rear stairway, but,
as Cassidy had no idea of spiriting Ned away,
desiring, in fact, to only keep him secure, there
was no need of guarding the back.</p>

<p>It seemed a long time before Mr. Wilding arrived
with the detective. About the same time
Frank and Fenn got to the place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have told the detective all about it, as far
as we know the circumstances,&rdquo; Mr. Wilding said.
&ldquo;Are you sure Ned is in there, William?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Almost positive,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;The
man admitted as much. He says Ned stole money
from him and has to work to pay it back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon see about it,&rdquo; the detective put in.
&ldquo;I know Cassidy. He&rsquo;s a rough sort, but he&rsquo;s
square I guess. Come on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Up the stairs they went, the hearts of the boys
beating with anxiety. Mr. Wilding&rsquo;s face showed
the strain he was under but, as for the detective,
he seemed to take it all as a matter of course. He
had seen too many similar scenes to be affected.</p>

<p>The little party entered the main room of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
lodging house. Mr. Wilding pressed forward,
close behind the detective. Through the office
window he caught sight of a boy scrubbing the
floor. There was something dejected in the lad&rsquo;s
appearance. Mr. Wilding looked a second time.
Then he called out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ned! My boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; cried Ned, and an instant later he
was locked in Mr. Wilding&rsquo;s embrace, while the
tears, which he did not try to conceal, streamed
down his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; fairly yelled William. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
found him!&rdquo; and he began dancing around the
room.</p>

<p>At the sound of William&rsquo;s cry Ned looked up
and saw his chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;where did you all come
from?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We came after you,&rdquo; replied Bart, &ldquo;and a
fine chase you led us. Where in the world have
you been, Ned?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here! What&rsquo;s all this row about in my
place?&rdquo; asked Cassidy, hurrying up from the rear
of the resort. &ldquo;You people have no right in
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy, Cassidy,&rdquo; advised the detective.
&ldquo;What about that boy?&rdquo; and he pointed to Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, Reilly,&rdquo; said Cassidy, as he recognized
the officer. &ldquo;Well, he robbed me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; retorted Ned, hotly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, you didn&rsquo;t kid!&rdquo; exclaimed a
husky voice, and a man, in ragged clothing, shuffled
into the light. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t take your money,
Cassidy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who did then?&rdquo; asked the lodging-house
keeper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Mike Jimson. I met him down the
street a while ago, and he told me. Thought it
was a good joke. He had a room next to you that
night and he slipped in while you were asleep. He
heard you accuse the kid here, but when the lad
got away he thought it was all right, and the next
day Mike lit out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; asked the detective.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure! Didn&rsquo;t Mike tell me? He showed
me some of the money. He&rsquo;s spent the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll have him locked up!&rdquo; Cassidy exclaimed.
&ldquo;I wonder how I could have made that
mistake? I thought sure it was you who took my
money,&rdquo; and he looked at Ned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for
what I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned was too happy over the outcome to reply.
He held his father&rsquo;s hand and his chums crowded
around him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Cassidy suddenly, holding out
five one dollar bills to Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are they for?&rdquo; asked Mr. Wilding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess they&rsquo;re his. Anyhow four and a half
belongs to him. The rest is interest. I took &rsquo;em
from under his pillow thinking they were mine. I
hope you&rsquo;ll let this thing drop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made a serious mistake, Cassidy,&rdquo;
Detective Reilly said. &ldquo;You are liable to be
sued for damages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll not prosecute me,&rdquo; whined the
lodging house keeper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a question we can settle later,&rdquo; said
Mr. Wilding sternly. &ldquo;Come, boys, let&rsquo;s get
away from here. We will go to my hotel, and
then I&rsquo;ll send a telegram to our friends in Darewell.
They are very anxious to hear from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you arrest Mike and get my money back,
Reilly?&rdquo; asked Cassidy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe, later,&rdquo; the detective replied. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t deserve it, for the trouble you caused,&rdquo; and
he followed Mr. Wilding and the boys to the
street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Ned, it wasn&rsquo;t that accusation that kept
you in hiding, was it?&rdquo; asked his father as they
walked along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;&rdquo; Ned answered with a look at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the detective. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m wanted on another
charge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wanted on another charge? What in the
world do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why I bought some stock in the Mt. Olive
Oil Well Company,&rdquo; Ned explained, still eyeing
the detective. &ldquo;I got it from the brokers, Skem
&amp; Skim. I went back to have a mistake in the
figures corrected and I found the firm had fled and
the postal authorities were in charge of the offices.
I overheard the inspector say they wanted a young
fellow who had bought two hundred shares of the
stock and I knew it was me, so I ran away. I
didn&rsquo;t want to be arrested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t mind, now!&rdquo; he went on, as he
drew the stock certificate from his pocket and
handed it to his father. &ldquo;You can lock me up,
if you want to,&rdquo; turning to the detective. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
tired of dodging around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see that paper?&rdquo; asked the officer, and
he took it to a light where he could read it. As
he looked it over a smile came to his face. &ldquo;Well,
well, you certainly had a big scare for nothing,&rdquo; he
remarked to Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know all about the case. I helped work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
on it. We located Skem &amp; Skim in Boston and
they&rsquo;re under arrest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But about me? About the two hundred
shares of stock that the inspector was talking
about?&rdquo; asked Ned anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two thousand shares was what he said I guess,
but you probably misunderstood him,&rdquo; Mr. Reilly
went on. &ldquo;Yes, there was a young fellow who
was mixed up in the transactions. He was a
holder of two thousand shares of the stock. All
there was in fact, and he was one of the main
ones in working the swindle. We&rsquo;re looking for
him still. Why, my boy, this paper isn&rsquo;t worth
anything. They cheated you. There isn&rsquo;t any
stock in the Mt. Olive Oil Well Company except
the fake two thousand shares issued to John Denton,
which is the name of the other swindler we
want. And so you thought the inspector meant
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did, and that&rsquo;s why I ran away. I didn&rsquo;t
want to be arrested and bring disgrace on my
father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You poor boy!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Wilding.
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all over now, Ned. How in the world
did you manage to live in the meanwhile?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned told them part of the story as they walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
to his father&rsquo;s hotel, and the remainder of it he
related inside, from the time of his aunt&rsquo;s departure
until they found him scrubbing the lodging-house
floor, including his escape down the rope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we have your valise!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s at our hotel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought some one came along and stole it,&rdquo;
Ned replied. &ldquo;I was afraid to ask about it for
fear I&rsquo;d be arrested. I didn&rsquo;t even dare go for
my trunk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s safe at the depot,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;but
you&rsquo;ll have to pay storage charges on it. Well,
well, how this thing has worked out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve solved two mysteries instead of one,&rdquo;
Frank remarked. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s William ready to go
back to his mother,&rdquo; and he told Ned who William
was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re the boy who was watching me this
afternoon when Cassidy came for me?&rdquo; Ned
asked. &ldquo;I was afraid you might be a detective,
and so I wouldn&rsquo;t admit who I was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll start for home in the morning,&rdquo; declared
Mr. Wilding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And maybe get into more trouble there,&rdquo; put
in Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Ned. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s any more
trouble I want to get it all over with at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
&ldquo;They suspect us of blowing up the school
tower!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that!&rdquo; cried Mr. Wilding. &ldquo;I guess
I forgot to tell you about that, I was so busy
thinking of Ned. That&rsquo;s all cleared up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They found out it was done by a wicked boy
named Peter Sanderson. He thought it was a
joke to set off a dynamite cartridge, but he found
out it wasn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s been sent to the reform
school and his father has to pay a big bill for
damages. I got a letter from Fenn&rsquo;s father this
morning, telling me all about it. So you boys can
go home with everything cleared up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll take William with us,&rdquo; said
Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. I guess William&rsquo;s troubles
are over too. We need a boy in the bank, and I
think he will fill the bill,&rdquo; and Mr. Wilding
laughed.</p>

<p>They were all so excited that none of them
slept well that night, but they were up early and
started back for Darewell.</p>

<p>Ned rather expected his father would express
regret at the loss of the hundred dollars, for Detective
Reilly said there was little chance of the
money ever being recovered. Mr. Wilding, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
did not refer to it, until Ned, anxious to
know how his parent felt, remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m not much of a business man, dad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Wilding with a
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I lost my hundred dollars the first
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly lost it, Ned, though you haven&rsquo;t
got it. You can consider that you bought a hundred
dollars worth of experience, and I think you
got quite a lot for your money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly did,&rdquo; replied Ned with conviction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; his father went on. &ldquo;I got a
telegram from your aunt. Her niece in Chicago
is not as ill as was at first believed, and Mrs.
Kenfield is coming home soon. She wants you
boys to stay and visit her. Your uncle will be
home from Europe in another week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d rather go home for a while,&rdquo; answered
Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, everything came out all right,&rdquo; remarked
Bart as he and Fenn sat together looking
from the car windows as they approached their
destination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, everything is right but Frank,&rdquo; replied
Fenn. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been acting strangely lately,&rdquo; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
he nodded toward his chum who sat alone in a
seat on the other side of the car.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what ails him?&rdquo; Bart remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to find out. It certainly is something
strange,&rdquo; went on Fenn. What the mystery was
will be told in the third volume of this series, to be
called, &ldquo;Frank Roscoe&rsquo;s Secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little later the train drew into the Darewell
depot. There was quite a crowd to welcome the
boys, for their story was partly known. Mr.
Wilding had telegraphed to the families of Ned&rsquo;s
chums, that the mystery was solved and the trouble
at last ended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see any great actors, Fenn?&rdquo; asked
Jennie as she greeted the boys. &ldquo;Tell me all
about them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only actor we saw was John Newton, the
&lsquo;Marvelous Bird Warbler,&rsquo;&rdquo; replied Fenn, &ldquo;and
we left him there. He certainly can whistle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, tell us all about it!&rdquo; begged Alice.
&ldquo;Did you see any accidents?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t have time,&rdquo; her brother replied. &ldquo;But
come on home. I want to see the folks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There we will take leave of the boys and girls,
as they trooped up the platform, talking, laughing,
and asking and answering scores of questions.
Only two in the crowd were rather silent. Frank,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
who seemed gloomy and depressed, and William.
But William was only quiet because of the great
happiness he felt in knowing he would soon see his
mother and sisters, from whom he had been so
long separated. Two hours later he was with
them, telling all about the way the chums found
him, and of Ned&rsquo;s disappearance so strangely
solved with his aid.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
